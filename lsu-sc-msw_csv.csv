Libraries	2006-02-08	1989	Natchitoches Parish	1976-1989	"This attractive member of the mostly tropical dogbane family has been reported in Louisiana and Mississippi and was thought for a time to be extinct in the wild. Recent interest in rare plants has shown that the Louisianan blue-star still grows in a few places in the central part of Louisiana. A population of Amsonia discovered in Georgia about a year ago may indeed be this species. The larger flowers and the downy, soft undersides of the leaves distinguish this species from the more common Amsonia tabernaemontana. The Louisiana blue-star reminds us of how much there is to be learned about many of our native species." -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.16	APOCYNACEAE	Dogbane Family	April 4, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-24	1989	Terrebonne Parish	1976-1989	"Hybrids between different species of Iris may be formed under appropriate natural conditions. In parts of southern Louisiana, red iris and some of the blue flowering species, I. brevicaulis and I. giganticaerulea, have crossed with one another in various combinations. So diverse was the array of color variations from these natural crosses in southern Louisiana that early in this century [20th Century], J.K. Small, preeminent specialist on the southeastern flora, and E.J. Alexander, a collaborator, recognized more than eighty species of Iris from this state alone. Later investigators subsequently demonstrated that this variation was due to interspecific hybridization rather than specific diversity. Contemporary specialists are continuing to unravel the details and significance of such hybridizations by doing controlled ecological experiments and by using comparative studies of nucleic acids. Louisiana iris hybrids are popular garden ornamentals, and new cultivated varieties are continually being developed by iris enthusiasts."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 99	IRIDACEAE	Iris Family	April, 1983	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Like many other members of the figwort family, its roots parasitize other species of plants. Its woolly stems grow to about fifteen inches tall and support many leaves whose finely divided blades have a fernlike appearance. A congested raceme of showy yellow flowers about eight inches long terminates the stem. Individually, the flowers consist of a green, tubelike calyx and a conspicuously bilabiate corolla whose strongly incurved upper lip has a hooded appearance. Within the corolla are four stamens. Pedicularis, a genus of about five hundred species of north temperate distribution, is named for a louse.

Libraries	2006-03-27	1989	Caddo Parish	1976-1989	"Lundell's locoweed is a low perennial with many branches bearing featherlike leaves and terminal, compact racemes of pale lemon-yellow flowers and, later, beanlike fruit. This rare species of locoweed is restricted to deep, sandy soils in western Louisiana and eastern Texas. Because of its rareness, it had never been given a common name until the author provided it with one. Various members of the genus are called locoweed because they absorb selenium from the soil and consequently cause nervous disorders in livestock that graze on them. Astragalus, a large genus of about fifteen hundred species, grows mostly in arid regions. Because only six species of Astragalus are known in Louisiana, they are local curiosities." -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.57	FABACEAE	Legume Family	April 4, 1984	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-12	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Roadside ditches, pastures, and lawns may be colored a misty blue in the early springtime by large colonies of lyre-leaved sage. Basal rosettes of pinnately round-lobed leaves, the veins and lower surfaces often shaded purple, characterize the foliage. One to several four-angled, flowering stalks up to eighteen inches tall may develop from a single rosette. Its upper half bears a number of whorls of flowers, each with a two-lipped calyx that is typical for the genus Salvia. Prominent features of the pale blue to violet corollas include a long, slender tube that, like those of most members of the mint family, forms a mouth-shaped opening; both lips have two or three smaller lobes. Within the corolla are two stamens and a four-lobed ovary. Lyre-leaved sage is widely distributed in the eastern United States. Although not well represented in the Louisiana flora, Salvia, with about seven hundred species, is a diverse group, especially in South America.

Libraries	2006-08-09	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"The gregarious colonies of mayapple commonly found on rich, moist woodlands are well known to wildflower enthusiasts. These unusual plants spread by means of creeping rhizomes. Each upright stem may grow to a foot or more tall and usually bears two large, peltate, orbicular, three- to nine- parted leaves. A single flower arises from between the petioles of the two leaves. Its fugacious perianth consists of six sepals and six to nine large, showy petals that surround the numerous yellow stamens. The fragrant flower gives way to an ovoid, many-seeded berry that is reported to be edible, though its seeds and its vegetative parts contain poisonous substances. Mayapple appears early in the spring and flowers and fruits in a short period. It is easy to cultivate if provided with a moist, shady environment. Podophyllum, a genus of nearly a dozen species, is mostly Asian; only this one grows in the United States. Although generally placed in the barberry family, some specialists segregate it into the Podophyllaceae."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 34	BERBERIDACEAE	Barberry Family	July 16, 1978 (flowers and fruit)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Leaves of this tendril-bearing vine are alternate and palmately three-parted. Its large, spectacular flowers, with five showy, bluish sepals and five similar petals, are about two inches in diameter. A number of unusual features--such as the corona, a crown of many threadlike filaments, and a stalk prominently displaying the stamens and pistil above the corona--are seen in maypop flowers. Their many-seeded fruits are soft and yellow when mature. Surrounding the seeds is a succulent, gelatinous substance that can be eaten directly or used to make a refreshing drink with a flavor similar to the commercially sold passion punch. Maypop may be cultivated for its fruits, attractive foliage, and sweet-smelling flowers. It is adaptable to a variety of soil conditions but must receive full sunlight in order to flower abundantly. Propagation may be accomplished by seeds, sucker shoots, and stem cuttings. Several other species of Passiflora have colorful and unusual flowers but generally are not hardy in subtropical or temperate areas."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 164	PASSIFLORACEAE	Passion Flower Family	August 21, 1980	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-09-23	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish||East Feliciana Parish	1976-1989	"The correct scientific name for meadow lily has been the source of considerable confusion. Generally, this plant has been called Alophia drummondii, Herbertia drummondii, or H. caerulea and has only recently been called Trifurcia. Its common name too is somewhat misleading, because this plant is a member of the iris family. This species, known from the coastal and prairie regions of eastern Texas and Louisiana, has a rather restricted distribution. It often grows in lawns, where it stature is much shorter than in areas not subject to mowing. Except when in flower, meadow lily is inconspicuous. About a half-dozen, narrowly linear leaves that grow to about eighteen inches long and a nearly leafless stem arise from a subglobose bulb buried deep in the ground. Each stem generally bears two delicate, short-lived, intricately colored flowers two or more inches in diameter. The outer three perianth parts are large, rather wedge-shaped, and typically a pale to dark lavender with a violet halo outlining the white, violet-spotted base. Its inner three perianth parts are much smaller and are a deep violet, sometimes with white spots near the base. The three narrow anthers lie against the style branches."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.100	IRIDACEAE	Iris Family	April 12, 1982; April 10, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

The generic name Oenothera was first used by the ancient Greeks, while the epithet for this species commemorates Thomas Drummond, an early botanical explorer of the western Gulf of Mexico region. Beach evening primrose may grow to about three feet in height from a woody, many stemmed base. Numerous hairs covering the stems and the simple, alternate leaves impart a silvery green color to the shoots. Like most evening primroses, the plant's large, bright yellow flowers are composed of four petals and eight stamens attached to the rim of a floral tube above the ovary. The flowers open near sunset and close during the middle of the following day. As the corollas age, they fade to a reddish color. Because this species is sometimes grown as an ornamental, its natural geographic range has been enlarged considerably."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 148	ONAGRACEAE	Evening Primrose Family	April 18, 1980	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

lsu-sc-msw:110	Mountain Laurel	Kalmia latifolia L.	Barton, Betty||Barton, Paula	Stones, Margaret	1976	Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, La.). Libraries	2006-07-25	1989	Washington Parish	1976-1989	"Mountain laurel is noted for its handsome foliage and flowers. Its simple, shiny leaves are evergreen and leathery. Large, rounded clusters of flowers appear at the ends of the many branches in late spring. Each flower is about an inch in diameter and displays exquisite symmetrical beauty. The sepals and petals number five each, and the latter form a saucer-shaped corolla that ranges in color from nearly white to dark pink. The ten stamens of each flower are unusual because their anthers are held in small pouches in the corolla. This bizarre structure represents a mechanism to aid cross-pollination. An insect landing on a flower causes the anthers to release and spring forward, dusting it with pollen that may then be transferred to other flowers on other plants. Mountain laurel grows naturally from Louisiana to Florida and northward to Ohio and New York. In Louisiana, this species is quite rare, growing only on a few sites in Washington Parish. In the southern parts of its range, mountain laurel may attain thirty feet in height, but northward the shrubs are much smaller. Kalmia, a genus of about six species, is restricted to North America. Other widely known plants of the heath family include azaleas, rhododendrons, blueberries, and cranberries."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 68	ERICACEAE	Heath Family	April 22, 1978	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-09-16	1989	Livingston Parish	1976-1989	"Narrow-leaved skullcap grows in bogs, open, wet woodlands, and roadsides throughout most of the southeastern United States. This perennial may reach two feet in height. It possesses opposite leaves and four-angled stems characteristic of the mint family. The aerial parts of the plant are covered with large numbers of short, soft hairs. Flowers of this species are arranged in terminal racemes. Of special interest is the inverted, skullcap-shaped appendage borne on the calyx of species in this genus. Corollas of the narrow-leaved skullcap are about one inch long and are typically bright blue. Its four stamens are located under the hooded lobes of the upper corolla lip. Scutellaria is a widely distributed genus of about three hundred species with nearly a dozen recorded for Louisiana. The very large, cosmopolitan mint family is important for the large number of herbs cultivated for ornamental or culinary uses. Among the most familiar mints are basil, marjoram, oregano, peppermint, sage, spearmint, and thyme."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 102	LAMIACEAE	Mint Family	May 13, 1978	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-10-07	1989	St. Tammany Parish	1976-1989	"The narrow-leaved white violet (left) is one of the two white-flowered species that commonly grows in Louisiana. It is a so-called stemless type, which means it has short, underground stems. Its leaves form a rosette, and the first ones to appear in the spring are much shorter and wider than the narrowly lanceolate ones that appear later. The plant's solitary, nodding buds are supported on long stalks. Upon opening, the flowers, like those of other violets, are bilaterally symmetrical with five sepals and petals. The intricate veins on the lower half of the spurred petal are purple, while the upper half of this petal and the other four petals are white, sometimes with faintly colored veins. Narrow-leaved white violet is distributed throughout eastern North America. The species usually grows in moist, sunny locations in wet pine savannas and along ditches and woodland borders. Although the violet family in North America essentially consists of the genus Viola, it contains several species of tropical shrubs belonging to several different genera."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 208	VIOLACEAE	Violet Family	April 26, 1982	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Conspicuous on the inflorescence are the sterile flowers, which have three to four showy, petal-like sepals. These flowers are white during the spring when the plant flowers bloom, but persist and turn reddish in summer, then brown in the fall. The fertile pollen- and seed-producing flowers are small and partially concealed by the much larger sterile ones. The common name and the specific epithet for this species refer to the large, deeply four- or five-lobed leaves, which are shaped much like oak leaves. Its leaves are deciduous and are densely covered beneath with silvery hairs. The attractive, reddish brown bark of this species is smooth when young but is shed in papery, irregularly shaped plates on older stems. Oak-leaved hydrangea grows as an understory shrub in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and on slopes of ravines in deciduous woods of the southeastern United States. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental qualities."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 200	SAXIFRAGACEAE	Saxifrage Family	May, 1979	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-12	1989	Livingston Parish	1976-1989	"Late springtime is when obedient plant is seen in great abundance in wet roadside ditches and moist swales, primarily in extreme southeastern Louisiana. Its terminal racemes of large, pale lavender flowers are supported by stiff, upright stems that may grow to about three feet in height. Within their two-lipped corollas, and adding to their beauty, are intricate patterns of darker purple dots and lines that presumably serve as nectar guides for pollinating insects. Not only are the flowers attractive, they are also obedient, because when moved from side to side, they will remain where they have been positioned. Physostegia angustifolia has been recorded in other parts of Louisiana and from Texas to Alabama northward to Missouri. The genus, readily placed in the mint family because of its square stems, opposite leaves, and certain floral features, embraces approximately a dozen species. Although Physostegia is widely distributed in North America, the greatest concentration of its different species can be found in western Louisiana and eastern Texas. At the time this drawing was executed and prior to it, our plants were thought to be P. virginiana, but more recent investigations have revealed this to be a more northern species. P. virginiana is the correct name for the common species in Louisiana."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 90	LAMIACEAE	Mint Family	May 23, 1979	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Orange candy root (right) normally develops a solitary stem that may form a few to several branches each ending with a cluster of flowers. All five of the sepals are bright orange, and the inner two are large and petal-like. The three petals are fused along nearly their total length and terminate in a four-lobed crest.

Even without flowers, this species is readily recognizable by its paired, ovately shaped, and often variegated leaves. In the springtime, pairs of sweetly scented flowers with white, trumpet-shaped corollas develop from the branch tips. Typically, the flowers are four-merous, i.e., there are four corolla lobes, stamens, and style branches. Two flower forms occur within the species; in one, both the stamens and the styles are exerted from the corolla, and in the other, the stamens are included within the corolla. Presumably, such structural variations promote cross-pollination. Ovaries of the paired flowers are fused to one another and jointly form a bright red, berrylike fruit with two "eyes," which are formed by the remnants of the calyces from the paired flowers. The fruits are reportedly edible but seem rather flavorless."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 198	RUBIACEAE	Madder or Coffee Family	May 6, 1978	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Its natural habitat includes the edges of bottomland forests, low prairies, and wet, disturbed areas. It is one of our four species with essentially white corollas often tinged with blue or purple. In habit, P. tenuis is similar to the red penstemon, and though much less colorful, it is nevertheless attractive, especially when growing in mass. Distinguishing it from the other native species depends on recognizing a number of rather trivial features such as the serration along the leaf margins and the size, shape, and pubescence of the corolla and the staminode. Although not readily available for cultivation, native beard-tongues offer considerable potential as garden ornamentals, and they may become as popular here as they are in other parts of the country."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 203	SCROPHULARIACEAE	Figwort Family	May 7, 1980	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-19	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Notorious for its astringent fruits, persimmon is a common, well-known tree found in various predominantly upland habitats. Although the orange, soft-textured, fully ripened fruits are flavorful, they provide little substance because of their numerous, large seeds. Nevertheless, persimmons may be an important wildlife food. The trees are functionally dioecious-that is, individuals produce either fruit or pollen-and both types must be growing near one another for successful fruit production. Pollen- and fruit-producing flowers are superficially similar in size and have greenish yellow, four- to five-lobed, bell-shaped corollas. Other characteristics that serve to identify the persimmon include its dark, checkered trunks and its simple, alternate, smooth-margined leaves borne on short stalks and usually covered on the undersides with small, soft hairs."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 54	EBENACEAE	Ebony Family	April 28, 1982 (male flowers); May 2, 1982 (female flowers); October 5, 1981 (fruit)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-10	1989	Winn Parish	1976-1989	"Phacelia strictiflora ranges from Alabama westward to Oklahoma and Texas. It is known to grow in only a few localities in central and western Louisiana where it is found in deep, sandy soils. When fully developed, phacelia has many branches arising from its base. Along each one are the rather evenly spaced and progressively smaller, deeply lobed leaves. Each branch is tipped with a coiled cluster of flower buds that progressively unfolds as the flowers open. Generally, four or more flowers open at one time; their saucer-shaped, lavender to purplish corollas highlight the darker purple anthers. Like most members of the waterleaf family, phacelia has two-cleft styles. This particular species lacks a trivial name, though others have fanciful appellations like Miami Mist and California Bluebells. Phacelia, a genus of approximately two hundred species, is most diverse in the western United States, with only a half dozen or so species in the East. Some phacelias, though not the present species, cause contact dermatitis. Several of the western species are grown from readily available seed for their showy flowers."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 97	HYDROPHYLLACEAE	Waterleaf Family	April 22, 1983	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Rooting in the mud, this aquatic plant produces upright stems as tall as three feet. Arising from near the plant's base are several erect, long-petiolate leaves with cordate to lanceolate blades. Just below the base of the inflorescence is a heart-shaped, leaflike bract. Elongated spikes of bilaterally symmetrical flowers appear in late spring, and flowering may continue throughout the summer. The sepals and petals are showy and bluish violet, and the upper segment bears a yellow mark. Six stamens of two lengths are attached within the perianth, and a single-seeded fruit matures from the ovary. A small solitary bee, Dufourea, appears to depend completely on a pickerel weed for its livelihood. Pickerel weed is attractive and worthy of planting in a garden pond, especially one in a natural setting. It is related to water hyacinth, the introduced, attractive, but troublesome weed of waterways in the southern United States."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 192	PONTEDERIACEAE	Pickerel Weed Family	June 2, 1978	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Sitting atop its sparsely branched stem are several large, closely clustered, showy flowers, each subtended by a pair of long, leafy bracts. Sabatia gentianoides is one of the few species in the genus to have corollas of ten to twelve petals and a yellow, starlike eye highlighting the centers. S. gentianoides typically has seven or more petals, while other species in this genus have six or fewer. In Louisiana, S. dodecandra (marsh pink) has similar flowers, but its closely associated bracts are the same length as, or shorter than, the petals. A few more technical features serve to distinguish these species.

Libraries	2006-09-16	1989	Rapides Parish	1976-1989	"Most grasses have little to offer in terms of attractive flowers or foliage; the piney woods dropseed is one of the few exceptions. A tufted perennial, this species grows in sandy soil in forest openings and along woodland borders. Its many stems may grow to three feet in height, though they are usually shorter, and its numerous, slender leaves are mostly confined to near the plant's base. A variety of colors is seen within the tall, narrowly pyramidal inflorescences when the plants are in flower. Grass flowers are unusual; they lack a perianth but are enclosed by a pair of bracts and are usually arranged into multi-flowered structures called spikelets. When first in flower, the intricately arranged bracts are reddish purple, and the three anthers of each flower are bright orange. The fruit of this species is a tiny grain.

Libraries	2006-03-31	1989	Rapides Parish (flowers)||Washington Parish (fruit)	1976-1989	"The beauty berry, also called French mulberry, is one of the most common and widely recognized shrubs of the moist to dry upland forest borders and lightly shaded pine woods. Dense clusters of lavender-pink flowers adorn the upper leaf axils and give way to vivid, magenta, berrylike fruits in autumn. The simple, deciduous leaves of beauty berry are alternate to whorled and have somewhat-toothed margins. This many-branched, medium-sized shrub is sometimes grown for ornamental purposes because of its attractive, unusual fruits and its adaptability to various soil conditions. Occasionally, white-fruited forms of this plant appear in the wild, and some of these have been selected for horticultural use. Although this genus is represented in our area by a single species, well over a hundred species are known to exist in tropical and subtropical regions." -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.206	VERBENACEAE	Vervain Family	June 7, 1982 (flowers); October 18, 1981 (fruit)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-31	1989	Iberia Parish	1976-1989	"Pink evening primrose, commonly seen along roadsides and in vacant lots, is one of our most abundant and showy wildflowers. Great colonies of this plant may color vast areas of the landscape pink or sometimes white in the early spring. These vivid floral displays are often encouraged by the sowing of seeds and by allowing the plants to mature until they reseed themselves. The flowers of this herbaceous plant have four sepals and four petals. Copious amounts of yellow pollen grains strung together by viscid threads are produced by the eight stamens near the center of each flower. Presumably, this is the reason these plants are sometimes called buttercups. Several other kinds of showy evening primroses are indigenous to Louisiana, but they are far less common than Oenothera speciosa. Other showy flowered members of the evening primrose family include the water primroses and the fuchsias, which are grown in cooler climates for their brightly colored flowers."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 156	ONAGRACEAE	Evening Primrose Family	April 23, 1977	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

It occurs in various wetland habitats such as swamps, bays, and wet woodlands. This large shrub or small tree may grow to nearly twenty feet tall. Possum haw is readily characterized by its opposite, smooth-margined, relatively short, petiolate leaves. Rusty scales generally are seen on leaf undersides, petioles, and young twigs. Flowers of the possum haw are arranged in somewhat-rounded, compact clusters that may be up to six inches in diameter. Each flower has five very small sepals, a pale, yellowish white corolla of five partially fused petals, and five stamens. The elliptical, deep blue fruits are covered with a whitish bloom. If possum haw receives full sunlight, it is practically covered with attractive flower clusters. The unpleasant odor emitted by the flowers limits the use of this species as a garden ornamental. Six other species of Viburnum are native to Louisiana, and several exotic ones are grown ornamentally."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 50	CAPRIFOLIACEAE	Honeysuckle Family	April 26, 1982	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Its broad leaves resemble those of canna, and its showy flowers are borne in pairs on tall, terminal, zigzag-branching inflorescences. The perianth consists of three minute sepals and three purple petals; its three stamens are petal-like, and only one bears a fertile, functional anther. The specific epithet refers to the white, powdery, wax-like substance on the inflorescence of this species and is the reason for this plant's common name. One of approximately a dozen species in this genus grows in Louisiana, another grows in Florida, and the others are found in the Americas and Africa. Most of the 350 species in the arrowroot family grow in tropical America. Roots of the West Indian arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea) are of considerable importance as a source of starch.

Like most members of the borage family, its stems and leaves are covered with coarse, stiff, white hairs, and its inflorescences when young are coiled like a scorpion's tail. As the flowers mature, the inflorescence axis straightens. The five-lobed calyx surrounds the base of the narrow corolla tube which abruptly flares into a five-lobed, disklike structure. Concealed within the corolla tube are five tiny anthers. Seeds are produced within each flower in four stony nutlets, as alluded to by the generic name, which literally means "stone seed." A rather extensive rhizome system develops below ground, and upon drying, it diffuses a violet-colored substance, staining the paper upon which specimens of this species are mounted.

Libraries	2006-07-19	1989	Caldwell Parish	1976-1989	"Purple coneflower is perhaps the best known and most widely grown species of Echinacea. Its natural geographic distribution centers in Missouri and Arkansas, but the popularity of this plant has led to its introduction throughout the eastern United States. Native populations of purple coneflower grow only in Caldwell Parish. Other reports for this species in Louisiana are probably from cultivation or garden escapes. This species has broader leaves and showier heads than those of the pale coneflower. Purple coneflower's disk is orange to gold, and its rays are broader and may vary in color from nearly white to purple. The popularity of tincture of Echinacea, extracted from the roots of various species in this genus, and used as a medicinal treatment for a variety of ailments, has waxed and waned during the last 150 years."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 26	ASTERACEAE	Sunflower Family	July 11, 1989	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

lsu-sc-msw:13	Bellwort	Uvularia sessilifolia L.	Thomas, R. Dale||Urbatsch, Lowell E.	Stones, Margaret	1976	Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, La.). Libraries	2006-10-07	1989	Lincoln Parish	1976-1989	"Bellwort is a delicate perennial that grows on rich, wooded hillsides. Its shoots emerge from a slender rhizome in the early spring. Their yellow-green, elliptic leaves are at first folded and closely clustered as the stem emerges, but they become more widely separated after they fully elongate. The pendant flowers, which appear with the new leaves, are a pale yellow. Their corollas are each composed of six similar segments and surround the six stamens and the three-parted ovary. Uvularia seems to be an unusual name for a plant. Apparently, the manner in which the pretty, pendant flowers hang from the inflorescence reminded Linnaeus, who named the plant, of the uvula of the palate. This eastern North American genus belongs in the lily family and contains five species. Besides U. sessilifolia, one other species, U. perfoliata, grows in Louisiana. The former is known only from some of the northern parishes, and the latter is restricted to the extreme southeastern part of the state."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 140	LILIACEAE	Lily Family	March 13, 1982	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-27	1989	West Feliciana Parish	1976-1989	"Pyramid magnolia has been discovered in only three parishes in Louisiana. Its total geographic range is confined to the region of the Gulf Coast from the Florida Panhandle to east Texas. Like the bigleaf magnolia, this species grows in the understory of rich, mesic, deciduous forests. Except for its smaller size, pyramid magnolia is similar to bigleaf magnolia. Its slender, light gray trunks support a rounded, branching crown. The branch tips support umbrella-like clusters of auriculately based leaves that are typically about one foot in length. Flowers of about six inches in diameter composed of nine perianth parts and many stamens and carpel appear after the tree's new leaves are well formed. The national champion pyramid magnolia, reported from Newton County, Texas, has a height of fifty-seven feet and a circumference of six feet four inches. A few pyramid magnolias have been successfully grown as interesting accent plants, but because this plant is generally unavailable, its performance in cultivation remains largely untested."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 130	MAGNOLIACEAE	Magnolia Family	April 15, 1985 (flowers); September, 1986 (fruit)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

This species is easily recognized during its flowering season in the late summer and fall. The plant grows to no more than two feet in height and characteristically produces a rosette of leaves that widen toward their apices. Several stems, which become many-branched upwardly, arise within the basal rosette and bear numerous threadlike leaves. This plant's flat-topped inflorescence consists of innumerable small heads composed of from two to five yellow disk flowers. As indicated by the common name, this species lacks the strap-shaped ray flowers often found in members of the sunflower family.

Libraries	2006-07-24	1989	West Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Red iris is one of the showy wildflowers commonly found along the margins of marshes and bayous in southern Louisiana. As in most species of iris, the perianth of Iris fulva consists of six petal-like members; the outer three are called falls, and the inner three, standards. In red iris, the standards and the falls tend to hang down. The petal-like style branches form the central part of the flower and conceal the stamens. Typically, the flowers are a rusty red, but yellow-brown and pinkish forms have been observed. The seed pods are six-angled, elliptical in outline and about two inches long. Red iris plants normally grow from two to four feet in height and bear strap-shaped leaves approximately one foot long. First discovered in the New Orleans vicinity in the early nineteenth century, the red iris was sent to England, where it caused quite a sensation, because it was the first iris species of this color known to science. In the wild, the red iris hybridizes rather freely with several of the blue-flowered species to produce a vast array of color forms. Many of these variations have been taken into cultivation and propagated."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 86	IRIDACEAE	Iris Family	April 13, 1979	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

This perennial species grows in deep sands in the northwestern part of Louisiana. Its violet to purplish stems support several pairs of connate-perfoliate, pale green, glaucous leaves marked with violet. Dozens of spectacular flowers typically arise at the base of each floral bract. Their scarlet, tubular corollas are surrounded at the base by a smaller, five-lobed calyx. Pollen is produced by four functional stamens included within the corolla. Subsequent to their development from the pistil, the capsules usually persist throughout the winter. Red penstemon is virtually impossible to transplant. More success has been reported by propagating this species from seeds.

Libraries	2006-09-23	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Trilliums, also called wake robins, are often regarded as the harbingers of spring. The new shoots of this herbaceous perennial grow from beneath the leaf litter in the moist, deciduous forests of the eastern United States and bear flowers early in the season before the trees form new leaves. Their generic name reflects the fact that the plant's parts come in threes, i.e., three leaflike bracts, sepals, and petals, six stamens, and a three-parted ovary. Red trillium's colorful, leaflike bracts mottled with various shades of green subtend a single, stalkless, upright flower. Sepals of the flower are spreading and green, and its upright petals are maroon. Trillium foetidissimum is restricted to extreme southeastern Louisiana and southwestern Mississippi, and it is the only Trillium in the Florida Parishes. Before it was described as a new species in 1975, it had been called T. sessile. The two plants differ in several technical features, and the latter species occurs from northern Alabama and Missouri northward."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.107	LILIACEAE	Lily Family	March 26, 1977	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries		1989	East Baton Rouge Parish		"Bigleaf magnolia, an uncommon tree of the moist, rich woods of certain stream drainage systems in central and southeastern Louisiana, is spectacular in having leaves as long as three feet supported in umbrella-like clusters at the branch tips. Its deciduous leaves are distinctive not only in size but also by their auriculately lobed bases and silvery undersides. Creamy white flowers one foot long open in late spring and would hold the undisputed title of our largest native flower, if there were such a designation. Typical conelike magnolia fruits develop from the numerous pistils of the flower and mature in the fall. Although they may attain heights of about seventy feet and trunk diameters of approximately two fee, most individuals typically remain much smaller trees. Bigleaf magnolia grows in the understory on rich but well-drained soils of riparian and slope forests of the southeaster United States. This species is not widely adaptable in cultivation, preferring conditions similar to those found in nature." -- Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 128	Magnoliaceae	Magnolia	May 1, 1978	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 38 x 57 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Numerous roots secure the rhizomes to the tree limbs and aid in the absorption of nutrients from rainwater. Scales that clothe the deeply dissected leaves may also assist the plant in gathering periodically scarce water and nutrients.

In our area, the stems are about four to five inches tall, and each bears one leaf at its midpoint and a leaflike bract below the inflorescence. Because of its single leaf, rose pogonia resembles the adder's tongue fern, and its specific epithet calls attention to this similarity. One or sometimes a few fragrant flowers individually subtended by a leafy bract are produced per plant. The petal-like sepals are spreading and resemble the two pale pink to rose petals that appear to hover above the column.

Its small, orbicular to kidney-shaped leaves have purple undersides, and at least when young, they are mottled above with dark green, purple, and sometimes silvery gray markings. Like most of our violets, V. walteri has blue-violet flowers. The spurred petal and the two lateral petals have darker veins and a basal, white to pale-colored blotch. Running violet has been reported growing in virtually all parishes except the coastal ones. Toward the end of its flowering period, specialized cleistogamous flowers are formed. These flowers develop on short stalks, never open, and produce seeds as a result of self-pollination. This flower type occurs in other kinds of violets and other plant species, possibly as the result of stressful growing conditions. The epithet commemorates Thomas Walter, author of Flora Caroliniana, published in 1788."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.186	VIOLACEAE	Violet Family	March 12, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-24	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Most of the approximately twenty-four species of Hypericum reported for Louisiana are herbs. Hypericum galioides is among the six shrubby species, and it may form thickets in swamps and long stream and ditch margins. Its stems frequently grow to six feet in height and branch profusely. The bark of the younger branches is reddish and smooth, but on the larger stems it tends to form thin, rough flakes. The younger twigs are crowded with numerous, small, evergreen leaves that have tiny, circular, surface depressions typical for members of this genus. Making their appearance in the late spring, the flowers consist of five green sepals, five bright yellow petals, numerous stamens, and a three-parted pistil. While Saint John's wort is sometimes grown as an ornamental, other species of Hypericum with larger flowers are generally selected for this purpose."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 98	HYPERICACEAE	Saint John's Wort Family	June 2, 15, 1978	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-19	1989	Tangipahoa Parish	1976-1989	"Sampson's snakeroot is widely distributed in the dry, sandy soils of Louisiana, and it presents an attractive floral display, especially when grown in mass. The numerous, branching stems arising from the tuberous roots of this perennial bear several alternately inserted trifoliolate leaves. Arranged in dense, terminal racemes are its lilac flowers, resembling those of the pea plant. Its legumes, the fruit of Sampson's snakeroot, are tiny pods about one-half inch long. Sometime in the past, a concoction from the roots of this plant apparently was prescribed for the treatment of snakebite. Evidently, the results were not greatly successful. Sampson's snakeroot is colorful while in flower but has a rather short blooming season. Nevertheless, it could provide an attractive, early spring flora display in a naturalistic setting, and perhaps it has potential for use in roadside plantings. Psoralea, a genus of more than one hundred species mainly from tropical and subtropical regions, is sometimes subdivided into several smaller genera. Its name means "scabby" and refers to the glandular dots typically found on its lower leaf surfaces."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 92	FABACEAE	Legume Family	April 14, 1982	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Filé, a fine powder of ground sassafras leaves, imparts a distinctive flavor to gumbo, a popular South Louisiana dish. Sassafras tea, made by steeping pieces of the root or bark, has been a popular drink since the early colonization of this country. Sassafras oil, distilled from the bark of the roots, is used to flavor medicines and candy and in scenting some perfumes. Unfortunately, safrole, one major component of sassafras oil, has been shown to be mildly carcinogenic in laboratory animals. Sassfras is a deciduous, dioecious tree common in old fields and woodlands of Louisiana and the eastern United States. Leaves, especially of young trees, are mitten-shaped, and both right- and left-handed "mittens" as well as ones with two thumbs, are produced. Leaves of older trees--which incidentally can become one hundred feet tall with trunk diameters of three to four feet--tend to be unlobed. Both the male and the female flowers are small, yellowish green, and radially symmetrical with six perianth segments. Male flowers have nine stamens and release their pollen by means of tiny, flaplike doors, a feature characteristic of the laurel family. Sassafras fruits are purple drupes supported by a fleshy, enlarged, reddish petiole."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.108	LAURACEAE	Laurel Family	March 13, 1982 (flowers); July 19, 1985 (fruit); May 25, 1982 (leaves)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Long petiolate leaves, whose blades are speckled with tiny salt glands, arise from the base of the plant. Its aerial, somewhat dichotomously branched stems, bearing only small, scalelike bracts, appear leafless. Approximately a dozen flowers develop on one side of each ultimate branch. A narrowly funnelform, five-lobed calyx subtends a similarly shaped corolla, which may vary from lavender to deep purple. Both perianth members are scarious-that is, they are rather dry and paperlike. Because of this quality, flowering stems are readily preserved by drying, making this plant a favorite subject for dried floral arrangements. Sea lavender grows in wet, saline habitats along the coast of North America from northeastern Mexico to Newfoundland, Canada. In Louisiana, this species is found only in the coastal parishes."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 188	PLUMBAGINACEAE	Leadwort Family	September 20, 1979	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Its open, showy, pink flowers feature a prominent staminal column much like that of hibiscus. Below the corolla is a five-parted calyx subtended by a series of narrow involucral bracts. Seashore mallow grows to about four feet in height and has narrowly triangular, often three-lobed leaf blades. The species is adapted to saline conditions of salt marshes and is restricted in Louisiana to the coastal parishes. Under cultivation, this species will grow in nonsaline soils, and if provided with full sunlight, it will flower abundantly. Successful propagation can be achieved by germinating seeds or by rooting stem cuttings.

This small tree, which is found on rich, wooded slopes mostly of the coastal plain from eastern Texas to Virginia, may grow to twenty feet tall. Its simple, alternate, two-ranked leaves are abundantly covered with silky hairs. In silky camellia, four petals of each flower are white, sometimes with purple markings, while the fifth usually bears a greenish splotch; its numerous filaments are purple and support bluish anthers. The fruit of this species, a somewhat-roundish capsule, contains lustrous, lenticular seeds. Silky camellia, known from about a half-dozen parishes, is relatively uncommon in Louisiana. Although this species would be a highly desirable ornamental, it evidently cannot tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions. The camellia family is abundantly represented in our area by a plethora of cultivars of camellia and sasanqua.

Leaves of silverbell are alternate and have undivided blades and entire to remotely toothed margins. Within the twigs, the pith of this plant is chambered and offers a valuable diagnostic marker for the tree in a vegetative state.

Libraries	2006-08-12	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Perhaps originally native to the southeastern United States as far west as extreme southeastern Louisiana, the slash pine has had its range greatly expanded because of its importance as a timber species and a landscape plant. It is one of only seven species of gymnosperms and one of five kinds of pine that grow naturally in Louisiana. Like most other pines, it has a single upright trunk and progressively smaller branches upward, giving the tree a conical shape. Ephemeral, purple, pollen cones about two inches long are produced in abundance in the early spring. Much less conspicuous are the seed cones which are only about one-quarter of an inch long at the time of pollination but grow to six inches at maturity. This species is readily identified by its needles, which grow in bundles of twos and threes, and by its stalked, reddish brown seed cone. The national champion slash pine, reported from Florida, is 150 feet tall and has a trunk circumference of 11 feet 3 inches."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 188	PINACEAE	Pine Family	February 3, 1977; March 21, 1977 (cone)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-12	1989	Natchitoches Parish	1976-1989	"Aptly named, small butterwort is about one-third the size of the yellow butterwort. Its basal rosette of leaves may be from one to two inches in diameter. The leaves possess adaptations that enable them to prey on insects and other kinds of very small animals. Each of several flowering scapes that develop during the blooming cycle bears but a single flower. The calyx is two-lipped with three lobes composing the upper lip and two the lower. A conspicuous spur abruptly arises from the lower portion of the corolla tube, while the upper part widens out into five broad lobes. Typically pale blue, the corolla may range in color from nearly white to somewhat reddish with yellow markings. Like most insectivorous plants, small butterwort grows in somewhat-boggy savannas. It is known to grow in many of the western parishes in Louisiana, and it ranges from the coastal plain of Texas to North Carolina and into the Bahamas' Islands. Having a keen eye and a knowledge of where to look are required to successfully find this plant in the wild."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 103	LENTIBULARIACEAE	Bladderwort Family	April 7, 1984	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-08	1989	Tangipahoa Parish	1976-1989	"Rhexia is the only genus of the large, mostly tropical meadow beauty family to grow in the United States, where it is represented by approximately a dozen species. These are readily recognizable by their four angled stems and opposite, simple leaves with three main veins running from the leaf base to its tip. The flowers of all species are exquisite. Smooth meadow beauty (center), with its glabrous, upright stems that branch only in the inflorescence and its vividly colored flowers, is one of the showiest. Its four rose-lavender petals are about one inch in length, and its eight bright yellow anthers site on filaments having an elbowlike bend. The urn-shaped fruits persist on the plant long after its seeds have been shed. Smooth meadow beauty flowers throughout the summer and provides one of the main sources of color in its native habitat, the wet pine savannas of extreme southeastern and central Louisiana. Although this species has been little used as a garden plant, it has considerable potential in this regard. Most likely it could be propagated from seed and would require moist, but well-drained, acid soil in a sunny location. Rhexia mariana (left) is a common, highly variable species that grows in similar habitats. This species differs from the smooth meadow beauty in having pubescent stems and diverse shades of pink to rose petals."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 132	MELASTOMATACEAE	Meadow Beauty Family	July 6, 1984	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-12	1989	West Feliciana Parish	1976-1989	"Graceful, arching, leafy stems typify Solomon's seal, a plant of the rich, wooded slopes of eastern North America. From the axils of each leaf are two or sometimes more pendulous flower; each blossom's six-parted perianth is fused into a tubular corolla with tiny lobes. Within the corolla are six stamens, the number typical for members of the lily family. Berries, the fruits of this plant, are fist green, turning dark purple when mature. Shoots and roots of Solomon's seal are said to be edible. Although reported from several parishes, this species is uncommon in Louisiana. Solomon's seal is a relatively easy plant to grow in the shade garden if provided with rich, moist, but well-drained soil. Different accounts have been given for this plant's common name. The leaf scars on the rhizome resemble a seal's impression into the wax used on letters or documents in former times. Alternatively, the ancients thought that medicines prepared from the roots of this plant had magical healing properties like those of the healing acts that could have been performed by Solomon."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 116	LILIACEAE	Lily Family	April 13, 1986	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

The bark of the older trunks of this medium sized tree in the heath family is dark and deeply furrowed. Its deciduous sour-tasting, simple leaves are bright medium green in summer and turn a brilliant scarlet to reddish purple in autumn. Clusters of slightly arching inflorescence branches, aligned along their lower sides with many small flowers, droop from the twig tips in late spring. Within the urn-shaped corollas, pollen and nectar are produced, providing a valuable source of honey. "Sourwood honey for sale" signs are commonly seen on a drive through the Blue Ridge of the mid-Atlantic states. Although pendulous when in flower, the pedicels grow to an upright position as the capsules mature. Sourwood is a desirable landscape plant, though it is difficult to grow in the lower part of Louisiana because of the lack of well-drained soils."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 55	ERICACEAE	Heath Family	June 13, 1978	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

The numerous bell-shaped flowers are one to two inches long with purple spotted, white corollas, which have two interior yellow stripes and ruffled margins. Clusters of pods, which individually reach eighteen inches long, subsequently develop and remain on the trees for some time.

Because of its beauty and abundance, this tree's blossom was designated in 1900 as our state flower by the Louisiana Legislature. Southern magnolia is easily distinguished by its glossy, evergreen leaves whose undersides are typically rust colored. Prized for their fragrance, the beautiful, creamy white flowers bloom from April to June. In true magnolia fashion, each flower is composed of several showy, spoon-shaped petals and numerous stamens and pistils disposed in spiral ranks. Fruits, which mature from September through October, are conelike aggregates of follicles. Lustrous, bright red seeds remain suspended for a time by thin threads after the fruit opens and present a colorful display. Southern magnolia, slow growing and long lived, may attain a height of nearly one hundred feet.

This orchid is often overlooked because of its small stature, its short life span, and its brownish green color, which camouflages it against leaf litter on the forest floor. Rarely more than six inches tall, the slender upright stem of this plant bears two opposite, ovate leaves. The word tway may have been derived from an Old English word meaning "two." Its racemose inflorescence supports from ten to thirty minuscule, greenish purple flowers. The lip, which is split into two lobes, is the most conspicuous part of the flower. Both lateral petals and the three sepals are less than two millimeters in length. Martin Lister, an English physician and naturalist, is commemorated by the generic name, while the specific epithet means "southern." Among the twenty-five species in this genus of temperate distribution, southern tway blade has the most southerly distribution."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 152	ORCHIDACEAE	Orchid Family	March 8, 1979	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

lsu-sc-msw:178	Spanish Moss	Tillandsia usneoides (L.) L.	Brown, Clair A.	Stones, Margaret	1976	Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, La.). Libraries	2006-08-19	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Garlands of Spanish moss drooping from live oak, cypress, and other kinds of trees characterize the southern landscape. This epiphyte merely uses trees and, in some cases, other objects, such as telephone wires and fences, for support. The long, pliable stems of Spanish moss bear numerous leaves covered with scales that aid the plant in capturing water not readily available in its humid but soilless environment. The flowers of this species have three sepals and three greenish petals and give rise to brownish fruits containing numerous, small, plumose-appendaged seeds that become airborne when released. Designation of this plant as "moss" is a misnomer because it is a flowering plant belonging to the pineapple family. Spanish moss has been used for pillow and mattress stuffing, and the collecting and ginning of this plant was once a viable industry in Louisiana."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 78	BROMELIACEAE	Pineapple Family	March 17, 1977	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-25	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Spice bush is a frequently encountered shrub of the bottomland hardwood forests. It is most conspicuous in the springtime, when small clusters of tiny yellow flowers appear before the leaves, and again in autumn, when the elliptical, shiny, crimson fruits mature. Spice bush is polygamo-dioecious-that is, pollen-bearing and seed-bearing flowers grow on separate plants, but such individuals may have bisexual flowers as well. The pollen-bearing flowers are the most conspicuous. Their anthers, true to their familial heritage, shed pollen not simply by splitting but by opening flaplike doors. Leaves of Lindera are simple, alternate, and elliptic in outline. When crushed, they emit a spicy fragrance. Chewing the twigs of this plant is said to give some relief from a sore throat. Camphor, an ingredient in many commercial medicines, apparently is the active substance in spice bush. The plants tolerate a broad range of growing conditions and would add an element of interest to the garden."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 102	LAURACEAE	Laurel Family	March 3, 1979 (flowers); September 23, 1982 (fruit)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-24	1989	West Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Spectacular clusters of handsome white flowers of the spider lily dot the wet meadows and ditches throughout much of Louisiana in the springtime. The flowers are strongly fragrant, especially in the evening. Within the flower, a disk-shaped structure called the corona connects the bass of the stamen filaments and serves to readily characterize Hymenocallis. Attached beneath the corona and projecting far beyond its outer rim are six narrow perianth segments that are fused together basally, forming an elongated floral tube. Spider lily fruits are fleshy, three-parted capsules with several large seeds. This plant's strap-shaped, dark green leaves arise from a bulb securely anchored in the wet, marshy soil. Spider lily is an attractive and easily grown garden ornamental. Hymenocallis is represented in the southeastern United States by several other species whose taxonomy is poorly known, making the application of the names difficult."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 3	AMARYLLIDACEAE	Amaryllis Family	May 10, 1978	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-17	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"The intricate color and structure of the spiny thistle, a plant common to the roadsides and pastures of Louisiana, can be appreciated more fully by observing this drawing. This member of the sunflower family is typical in having small flowers arranged in heads that themselves have the appearance of individual flowers. This plant is also called yellow thistle because the flowers are often pale yellow. Flowers in this genus typically are purple. Many parts of this thistle are spiny, including the many smaller leaves surrounding the heads and the tips of the lobes of the numerous stem leaves. Spiny thistle is a biennial. It produces great rosettes of long spiny leaves during the winter months and flowering stalks that bolt upward in the springtime. Young stems of this species are edible and possess a texture and flavor similar to celery. Thistles and their kin are closely related to the artichoke."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.24	ASTERACEAE	Sunflower Family	April 3, 1980	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

lsu-sc-msw:182	Spotted Beebalm	Monarda punctata L.	Urbatsch, Lowell E.	Stones, Margaret	1976	Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, La.). Libraries	2006-07-31	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Although the numerous, lavender inflorescence bracts are the showiest aspect of the spotted beebalm, the flowers themselves have an intricate and subtle beauty. The corolla of this plant not only is two-lipped, as in most mints, but has the appearance of a mouth suspended in a wide yawn. Both the common name and the specific epithet call attention to the maroon-spotted, pale yellow, corolla surfaces. Spotted beebalm is widely distributed in Louisiana and the eastern United States. In our area, the plant behaves as an annual or a weak perennial. Except for its tall, rather spindly appearance, it is attractive and may be a useful ornamental in natural areas. Monarda, a North American genus of about twenty species, contains a number of popular garden flowers such as the scarlet-flowered beebalm (M. didyma) and the wild bergamot (M. fistulosa). Most other species of Monarda are well-recognized wildflowers. The leaves of the various species are used in cooking and for making tea because of their minty flavor."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 101	LAMIACEAE	Mint Family	September 3, 1980	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-02-15	1989	Washington Parish	1976-1989	"Spreading aster is an erect perennial that grows to nearly three feet tall. It is quite common in open, dry fields and at the edges of woodlands in Louisiana and the eastern United States. The plant is readily recognizable by its nearly sessile leaves that have a basal pair of earlobe-like structures and by its branches, especially in the inflorescence, which diverge at nearly a ninety-degree angle from the main stem. The epithet refers to this branching pattern. The heads, which terminate the inflorescence, measure an inch or more across when in flower. They have a yellow disk and numerous bluish or sometimes white rays. Attached to the ovary where it joins the corolla is a series of bristles, called the pappus, which assist in the dissemination of the fruit by the wind." -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.7	ASTERACEAE	Sunflower Family	October 21, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-17	1989	St. Tammany Parish	1976-1989	"Spreading pogonia is a rare beauty found in wet meadows and bogs, where it grows among pitcher plants and sundews. From one to three flowers sit atop a stem bearing a solitary leaf. The central, tubular part of the flower consists of the lip, or lower petal, and the upper two petals, which close over the top of the lip, completely concealing the column contained within. In contrast to the pink, connivent, upper petals and crimson-veined lip, the deeply reddish purple sepals spread boldly upward and outward. Known in only a few localities in Louisiana, this orchid's rarity may be due to its specialized habitat requirements. More frequent appearances after the sites have been burned suggest that, as with many bog plants, its existence may depend on fire."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.149	ORCHIDACEAE	Orchid Family	April 25, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Although locally abundant, this species has a geographic distribution restricted to an area from the Florida Panhandle to eastern Louisiana. The many-branched stems of this plant bear somewhat leathery, simple, alternate, evergreen leaves crowded near the twig tips. When crushed, the leaves emit an unusual odor that some have described as reminiscent of fresh fish. Stinking laurel and pole-cat tree are names that refer to the odoriferous qualities of star bush. Flowers are produced in abundance, especially on plants receiving somewhat more sunlight. About twenty to thirty dark red, strap-shaped segments form the perianth.

The outer flowers of each head are raylike with five-lobed, strap-shaped ligules, and the central flowers are more disk-like. Surrounding each flowering head is a series of bracts with many soft, spiny teeth. Stokes' aster, a perennial herb, grows from a short rhizome and bears glabrous leaves that have a series of pointed, closely-spaced teeth near their bases. This species is readily propagated from seeds, which are available commercially, or from root cuttings. Stokes' aster prefers a sunny location with moist but well-drained soil, and it flowers in summer. Despite its common name, this species is not closely related to the asters but is kin to the ironweeds, Vernonia."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 32	ASTERACEAE	Sunflower Family	September 11, 1980	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-19	1989	Evangeline Parish (flowers)||East Baton Rouge Parish (fruit)	1976-1989	"The spectacularly colorful and unusual fruits of the strawberry bush are a woodland delight. The outer covering of the crimson, tuberculate fruit superficially resembles a strawberry. When the fruit opens, four or five fleshy, reddish orange seeds are exposed. A more romantic common name, which refers to the opened fruits, is "hearts bursting with love." The flowers, appearing in the spring, are much less conspicuous but also exhibit some interesting features. They are associated with of the opposite leaf axils and sometimes give the illusion of being attached to the leaves. A broad, flat disk of nectar-secreting tissue surrounds the ovary and supports five stamens and five greenish yellow petals attached to this outer rim. Given a sunny place in the garden, the strawberry bush will flower and fruit more abundantly than in the shade. In the wild, this species, a favorite of deer, is often severely browsed."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 51	CELASTRACEAE	Staff-Tree Family	April 20, 1979 (flowers); September 25, 1979 (fruit)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-09-23	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Bigleaf snowbell, a small tree found in deciduous, upland woods from Louisiana to Virginia, generally grows on bluffs and slopes bordering streams. In Louisiana, this plant is reported from nearly all parishes except the coastal ones. Leaves of this species are alternate and simple, and range in length from three to six inches. They have slightly serrate to dentate margins and are pubescent with star-shaped hairs. A good diagnostic field characteristic is the presence of two buds at each node. The bell-shaped, bisexual flowers, arranged in drooping, terminal racemes, typically possess five petals with recurving lobes and ten stamens. Small, subglobose capsules are produced from the partially tri-septate ovary. Bigleaf snowbell is cultivated to some extent, but its leaves become chlorotic in unfavorable soils. Styrax, the major genus of the storax family, contains about 130 species of mostly tropical trees or shrubs. Halesia, the silverbell, is another native representative of this family."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 205	STYRACACEAE	Storax Family	March 26, 1984 (flowers); July 8, 1984 (fruit and seed)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Stones, Margaret	1976	Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, La.). Libraries	2006-08-08	1989	Tangipahoa Parish	1976-1989	"Although widespread from Maine to Ohio southward and fairly frequent in wet woodlands and bogs and along the borders of swamps and bays, this species is less well known than the wild azalea. Summer azalea also can grow to about twenty feet tall, and it has alternate, deciduous leaves. Its flower buds, which are formed the previous season and over winter, are covered with a sticky, viscous substance--presumably, the reason for the epithet viscosum. This species flowers in very late spring or in summer after the leaves have matured. In flower, this plant is not as spectacular as the wild azalea; it has fewer flowers, which are somewhat concealed by the leaves, and its less-colorful corollas are creamy white. There is considerable controversy concerning the specific boundaries, and consequently the correct name, for this species. Summer azalea may be an interesting garden plant in moist to wet habitats. It could also provide genetic material for developing later-flowering varieties of azaleas by hybridization with other species."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 56	ERICACEAE	Heath Family	July 10, 1984	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

The bases of the several, evenly spaced, narrow leaves surround and clasp the stem and are reminiscent of dayflower leaves. A conical cluster of small, yellowish to white flowers terminate the leafy stems. Noteworthy features of the flower include the prominent spur formed at the base of the three-lobed lip, and the dorsal sepal and two other petals that arch over the lip. The summer woodland orchid is so named because of its specific epithet querceticola, which means "growing in oak woods," and because it is one of the few orchids of this region to flower in late summer.

However, in detail the two are quite different. Sunbonnets' leaves have a dense, felty mat of white hairs beneath, and their margins are sooth or possess small teeth. Sunbonnets' heads are composed of disk and ray flowers that are unequally lobed. Chaptalia is related to a primarily tropical group of sunflowers and is not close kin to the dandelion. Like many other members of the sunflower family, sunbonnets have heads that respond to light. At night and on cloudy days, the ray flowers form a brim around the nodding head, giving them a bonnetlike appearance.

Five small, greenish, acutely lobed sepals and five yellow petals fused into a funnel-shaped corolla compose the floral perianth. Attached within the somewhat darker yellow corolla throat are five stamens. Fruits of the jessamine are flattened, two-parted, many-seeded capsules. The swamp jessamine and the Carolina jessamine, which is widespread in Louisiana, are quite similar to each other.

Libraries	2006-09-23	1989	Washington Parish	1976-1989	"Leaves with the taste and smell of green apples are characteristic of sweetleaf, a common shrub or small understory tree of mesic to wet forests of the southeastern United States. Its alternate leaves are elliptic to oblanceolate, supported by yellowish petioles, and tend to remain on the plant throughout the winter. Sometimes galls are formed in response to a fungal infection, and from a distance these pale, yellow-green, puffy structures look like flowers. The sweetleaf's compact, closely se inflorescences appear prior to the new leaves, near the branch tips of the previous season's growth. Each fragrant flower has five small sepals, five creamy white petals, numerous stamens arranged in fascicles, and a single pistil with a three-parted ovary. Sweetleaf fruits are small, elliptical drupes. Symplocaceae contains only two genera and about five hundred species from the tropics and subtropics.

lsu-sc-msw:198	Tall Goldenrod	Solidago Canadensis L.	Hawkins, Julia	Stones, Margaret	1976	Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, La.). Libraries	2006-09-16	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"A profusion of bright yellow blooms is provided each fall by the tall goldenrod in roadside ditches and old fields and along the borders of woods. This robust, perennial plant readily grows in disturbed habitats and later gives way to other types of vegetation, thus representing an early successional species. It rapidly spreads by means of rhizomes, establishing large colonies. Its leafy, aerial stems may grow to seven feet in height and become many branched in the inflorescence. Close examination of the flowering heads shows that they each contain several small ray and disk flowers. Sometimes growing with the rough-leaved tall goldenrod is a similar species, seaside goldenrod, which has smooth leaves and somewhat-larger flowers. Goldenrod is often, though wrongfully, thought to be a common cause of allergies; its pollen, however, is carried by bees and is not airborne. The goldenrods happen to bloom at the same time as ragweed and marsh elder, both notorious for their allergenic properties. Solidago is represented in Louisiana by nearly twenty additional species, including several rare ones."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 45	ASTERACEAE	Sunflower Family	October 2, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Stones, Margaret	1976	Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, La.). Libraries	2006-08-12	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Texas coneflower is restricted primarily to seasonally wet pine savannas of western Louisiana and eastern Texas. Relatively large, upright, ovate, basal leaves with long petioles grow from an underground rhizome, which by midsummer produces a robust, flowering shoot. Clasping the upright stem at rather evenly spaced intervals are several, progressively smaller, broadly ovate leaves. Each of its few branch tips supports a large, cone-shaped head with about a dozen showy, reflexed, bright yellow rays. The disk, composed of approximately three hundred individual flowers, is about two inches tall and green in the bud stage but becomes purplish brown as its flowers progressively open. Until recently, the populations in Louisiana and Texas were considered to be a variety of Rudbeckia nitida, whose geographic range extends from southern Alabama and Georgia into northern Florida. Research has shown R. texana to be specifically distinct. Rudbeckia is a genus of approximately twenty species, including the widespread and often cultivated R. hirta."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 45	ASTERACEAE	Sunflower Family	June 19, 1978	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-10-07	1989	Rapides Parish	1976-1989	"Bird's-foot violet, a popular wildflower, is our largest and perhaps most attractive member of the genus Viola. Its flowers consist of two pairs of upper petals and one lower, spurred petal. Two color forms are seen in the wild: in one, all five petals are uniformly lilac; in the other, which is much rarer, the two upper petals are deep, velvety violet. Clustered in the center of the flowers are five orange-tipped stamens. The three-to five-parted leaves of this plant arise from a short, underground stem and bear some resemblance to a bird's foot--hence, it's common name. Viola pedata, a perennial herb, commonly grows throughout the pinelands of Louisiana and is known from much of the eastern United States. Many other wild species of violets can be seen flowering in various habitats in the springtime. The pansy is a popular ornamental species of violet."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.184	VIOLACEAE	Violet Family	March 22, 1980	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-10	1989	West Feliciana Parish	1976-1989	"Certain rich, beech-magnolia wooded hillsides in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, represent the southwestern extent of the geographic distribution of Allegheny spurge. Propagating by horizontal stems, this species forms large colonies on the forest floor. The mottled, variegated leaves, an outstanding feature of this plant, occur only near the upturned branch tips. The rather small, imperfect flowers are clustered together in spikes about three inches long that arise from the base of the leafy stems. The inflorescence varies from being composed entirely of all pollen-producing flowers to having a few seed-producing ones below the staminate flowers. Both the male and the female perianths consist of four sepals and no petals. A three-horned capsule develops from the female flower. Literally, and in reference to the four white, fleshy filaments of each male flower, pachysandra means "having thick, pollen-bearing structures." In appropriate habitats Allegheny spurge provides an attractive ground cover. World wide, approximately one hundred species compose the box family including the often-used hedge plant, boxwood."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 49	BUXACEAE	Box Family	April 10, 1985	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Its radially symmetric, fivemerous, white flowers appear in the late springtime. The subsequently developing clusters of small, dry fruits generally persist until the next flowering season and offer a good clue to the plant's identity. Similarly, the somewhat twisted and gnarled trunk with reddish cinnamon bark adds distinction and attractiveness to this plant.

This plant, normally a large shrub, may grow as tall as thirty feet. Its many outstanding qualities include its grayish brown outer bark, which peels off to reveal the reddish bard underneath. Its alternate, elliptic leaves are glossy green in summer, become purple to red in autumn, and are tardily deciduous. In the spring, a profusion of white, pendulous, urn-shaped, lily-of-the-valley-like-flowers appear on leafy racemes. Ten rather complex stamens with a sterile appendage and awns are concealed within the corolla. The dark purplish berries, about one-quarter of an inch in diameter, often persist on the plant well into the winter months.

It is a woody, twining or clambering vine widely distributed throughout the eastern United States. This species is often cultivated for its attractive tubular flowers, which are red on the outside and yellowish within. Because of their color, shape, and nectar production, these flowers are attractive to hummingbirds. Spherical fruits of various shades of yellow, orange, and red are produced in late summer and fall. The smooth, undivided leaves of coral honeysuckle occur in pairs. The uppermost pair is fused and completely surrounds the stem. The botanical name Lonicera commemorates the sixteenth-century German physician and naturalist Adam Lonicer. Its specific epithet means "evergreen"; plants grown in mild climate retain their leaves during the winter.

Libraries	2006-05-05	1989	Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England	1976-1989	"Easily recognized by its apically truncate, four-lobed leaves, tulip tree is widespread on mesic sites in the eastern United States. In certain habitats, it may be a predominant forest species and a giant as well. The national champion tree, growing in Virginia, is reported to have a height of 124 feet and a trunk circumference of 30 feet 3 inches. Its scientific name, which literally means "tulip bearing tulip tree," seems redundant but emphatically calls attention to the tree's attractive flowers. Six yellowish green perianth parts, the same number as in the tulip flower, are each highlighted with a vivid orange basal spot. Three greenish, reflexed stamens unfurl below the petals, and within occur numerous stamens and pistils. The rather conelike aggregates of winged fruits persist on the tree after its leaves have been shed. Tulip tree is an attractive ornamental because of its pyramidal form, its ash gray bark of interlacing ridges, and its unusual flowers and foliage. It is also a useful timber species."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 124	MAGNOLIACEAE	Magnolia Family	June, 1976 (flowers); August 25, 1976 (fruit)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Their resemblance to petunia is superficial, because the latter belongs in the nightshade family (Solanaceae). For Louisiana, six species of Ruellia have been recorded. Violet ruellia, an upright to sprawling herb with opposite leaves, grows to about thirty inches tall. Its inflorescences, terminal racemes of several flowers with five-lobed, lavender to violet corollas having four stamens attached within, appear in the summer. Several seeds attached to hooklike projections are formed in the two-parted, capsular fruit. The acanthus family, comprising about 2,500 species, is primarily tropical in distribution. Some species of Aphelandra, Crossandra, and Thunbergia (black-eyed susan), are cultivated as ornamentals.

Libraries	2005-08-10	1989	Evangeline Parish	1976-1989	"Violet wood sorrel is a delicate little plant that has been widely reported from dry, open woods throughout much of Louisiana. The trifoliolate leaves of this stemless plant arise from a scaly, underground bulb. Each of the leaflets is somewhat heart-shaped and usually violet to crimson beneath and green or variegated with purplish markings above. Like those of many Oxalis species, the leaflets exhibit sleep movements by folding down at night. Several five-merous, geraniumlike flowers are produced on each flowering stalk. Each of the petals, which may range in color from nearly white to violet, is tipped with an orange gland. Violet wood sorrel normally produces leaves and flowers in the spring, but in the late summer and fall it may flower without leaves. Although toxic in larger amounts, a substance called oxalic acid imparts a rather pleasant, sour taste to the foliage, which may be sparingly used to flavor salads. Oxalis is a genus of several hundred species. Some are useful as garden or indoor ornamentals, while others, such as yellow wood sorrel, are common, weedy species."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 155	OXALIDACEAE	Wood Sorrel Family	April 4, 1982	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Bark on the younger branches characteristically shows horizontal silvery bands, and the older bark is an irregular patchwork of plates. In the vegetative state, this plant can be readily recognized by a line of reddish hairs along either side of the midvein on the lower side of its simple, alternate leaves. Its individual, white, plumlike flowers are arranged in cylindrical racemes. Five small sepals subtend the five white petals surrounding the twenty or so stamens. The cherries, which develop from the single simple pistil, are purplish black and usually less than one-half inch in diameter. Their flavor may vary from bitter to sweet, depending on the individual tree. Black cherry may grow quite large.

Its alternate, trifoliolate leaves vaguely resemble those of poison ivy, which, of course, is a vine. Three kinds of flowers occur on individual plants: bisexual, pollen-bearing, and seed-bearing. All have minute sepals and four to five small, greenish petals. The pistillate flowers have imperfect, sterile anthers, and the staminate ones have nonfunctional pistils. "Wafer ash" describes the fruit, which consist of pale, yellowish green, disk-shaped samaras about the size of quarters. Typically, the fruits occur in relatively large, dense, conspicuous clusters.

Because of their more robust size, the Gulf and Atlantic Coast plants are distinguished, by some investigators, at the varietal level from those of the northeastern United States. Typical plants of the southern variety may grow to about three feet tall and support a raceme of from thirty to fifty showy white flowers. The three sepals are similar in size to one another and are somewhat larger than the lateral petals. Formed by modification of the third petal, the large, fringed, spurred lip is described by the epithet blephariglottis, which means "having a tongue with eyelashes." The long, slightly recurved spur secretes nectar, making the flowers attractive to butterflies and moths, which serve as pollen vectors. The white fringed orchid is similar to the yellow fringed orchid and was once believed to be an albino form of its orange cousin."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 152	ORCHIDACEAE	Orchid Family	September 7, 1985	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

It was not discovered in Louisiana until 1977. Because of its rareness, Trillium texanum is being considered for protection under the Federal Endangered Species Act. It is the only species in Louisiana with white flowers and the only one in this state that represents the subgenus of Trillium characterized by stalked flowers. Although several species in the subgenus have nodding flowers, white Texas trillium has upright flowers. Like other trilliums, its leaflike bracts, sepals, petals, and pistil are three-parted, and its stamens number six. The bracts of white Texas trillium are not mottled like those of other trilliums in Louisiana but uniformly green. The few populations in Caddo Parish occur in remote areas and apparently are not in imminent danger of extinction, unless forestry activities significantly alter the sites. Trilliums would make interesting garden plants if grown in natural habitats. Propagation by seeds is usually successful, but two or three years are required for plants to flower."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.

lsu-sc-msw:216	White Violet	Viola primulifolia L.	Hawkins, Mrs. R. M.	Stones, Margaret	1976	Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, La.). Libraries	2006-10-07	1989	Allen Parish	1976-1989	"The white violet (right) is exceedingly common in wet habitats such as bogs, ditch banks, and woodland streams throughout most of Louisiana. It is a stemless, white-flowered species that is readily distinguished from Viola lanceolata by its broader, shorter leaves and often heart-shaped leaf bases. Its spurred lower petal and its two lateral petals have violet to somewhat brownish veins. The lateral petals may bear several crowded hairs at their bases, forming a so-called beard. Its fruit, like that of other violets, is a three-parted capsule that opens rather explosively in order to disseminate its seeds more widely. Violets are relatively easy to grow as ornamentals if planted in a rich, moist, somewhat-shady habitat."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 208	VIOLACEAE	Violet Family	May 15, 1982	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-31	1989	St. Tammany Parish	1976-1989	"White water lily is one of the most common and best known of our aquatic plants. It is commonly found growing in ponds, lakes, and ditches from Arizona northward to eastern Canada. A substantial rhizome system generally forms on the substrate beneath the water. Often called "lily pads," the floating leaf blades are circular and about ten inches in diameter. The cup-shaped, generally fragrant, floating flowers are composed of numerous petals; the inner ones are transitional to the many yellow stamens. On sunny days, the flowers open wide during morning hours but close in the afternoon. Upon pollination by insects, the flowers close and the flower stalks coil, withdrawing the young fruit below the water's surface, where it matures. The genus Nymphaea comprises approximately fifty species, which grow in temperate and tropical regions. Numerous hybrids and plants in a variety of color selections are grown as ornamentals, but the use of native species for this purpose should not be overlooked."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 136	NYMPHAEACEAE	Water Lily Family	May 13, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-24	1989	Winn Parish	1976-1989	"Whorled pogonia is a delicate perennial found along streams in rich woodlands throughout much of the eastern United States. Although generally regarded as rare to uncommon, this orchid may often be overlooked because of its short stature and inconspicuous but large flowers. A single, upright, hollow stem about ten inches tall typically supports a whorl of five leaves and one large flower borne on a relatively long pedicel. Each of the three slender, spreading sepals is about two inches long and purplish. The column, a specialized structure composed of the stamens and the pistil, is surrounded by the lateral petals and the lip. Both lateral petals are a pale yellowish green, the same color as the central part of the lip, which is also edged in purple. Whorled pogonia's early springtime appearance has been recorded in several central and northern parishes in Louisiana. Plants seen in the vegetative condition in St. Tammany Parish also appear to be this species. Colonies of whorled pogonia are reported to lie dormant for ten or more years until conditions become conducive for flowering."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 151	ORCHIDACEAE	Orchid Family	April 9, 1983	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-19	1989	Washington Parish	1976-1989	"This well-known, large, deciduous-leaved shrub inhabits moist, sandy soils along many of the streams in Louisiana and the southeastern United States. Mature individuals may be nearly twenty feet tall. Their alternate leaves range from one to four inches long and are often crowded near the branch tips. A tangled mass of small, soft hairs typically cover this plant's twigs and lower leaf surfaces. Flowering buds are formed by midsummer and remain a prominent feature of this plant after its autumnal leaf drop. Immediately preceding or occurring with the new leaves in early spring, innumerable clusters of tubular, fragrant flowers completely cover the plant. Because of the shape of its corolla and its floral fragrance, this plant is sometimes called honeysuckle azalea. Colors of the petals vary from nearly white to a deep pink, depending on the genetic constitution of the individual. Wild azalea grows well in cultivation in moist, sandy acid soil and needs a sunny location to flower profusely."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 70	ERICACEAE	Heath Family	April 8, 1978	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-12	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Originally native to the Appalachian and Ozark Mountains, black locust is now naturalized throughout much of the United States and Europe. This often-cultivated ornamental produces copious amounts of seed, and unless controlled, it will generally form thickets by means of root sprouts once it is established. Wood from the trunks is said to be highly resistant to decay and is useful for posts and pilings. Black locust is a medium-size tree normally growing to about sixty feet tall. Leaves of this species are alternate and pinnately compound with as many as twenty-five leaflets. At the base of the leaf stalk and modified from the stipules is a pair of sharp spines that may be up to one inch in length. Appearing in the spring, its lovely, delicately fragrant flowers hang in pendulous racemes. The petals of the pealike flowers are a creamy white, and the standard bears a yellow patch. When fully formed, black locust bears beanlike pods about four inches long."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 92	FABACEAE	Legume Family	April 10, 1979 (flowers); October 1979 (fruit)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Long petioles, which arise from a short underground stem, support mottled, fleshy, evergreen, triangular leaf blades. Typically, one or two such leaves are formed each season, but with good growing conditions, several leaves develop. The unusual, fleshy, reddish brown flowers are found in the leaf litter and are generally seen only by the informed, alert naturalist. Lacking petals, the flowers consist of a fleshy calyx fused into a jug-shaped structure that contains the stamens and pistils. Wild ginger has a pleasant, gingerlike aroma and, reportedly, has been used as a seasoning.

Libraries	2006-07-21	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Wild hydrangea is widespread in the deciduous forests of the eastern United States. It is known from only a few localities in Louisiana, which is on the southwestern edge of this species range. Wild hydrangea is generally a shrub, but it may have weak stems that trail along the ground and root at the nodes. Bark of the older, larger stems is brown and, when it exfoliates, forms thin, papery patches. Leaves of wild hydrangea are opposite and simple, with mostly ovate blades, conspicuously serrate margins, and lighter green, somewhat-pubescent lower surfaces. At the ends of the branches are fairly large, convex clusters with a mixture of tiny fertile and sterile flowers. The sterile flowers develop on the ends of the inflorescence clusters and consist of three to four broadly elliptic, petal-like sepals. Beneath the sterile flowers are the fertile ones, which are bisexual with a fivemerous perianth and eight to ten stamens. The strongly ribbed ovary forms a brown, cup-shaped capsule. Wild hydrangea is readily distinguished from oakleaf hydrangea, which sometimes grows in the same habitat, by its unlobed leaves and convex inflorescence. Wild hydrangea makes an interesting plant in the shade garden, and various selections with more numerous, showy, sterile flowers are available."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 200	SAXIFRAGACEAE	Saxifrage Family	May 20, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-09-23	1989	Caddo Parish	1976-1989	"Woodland red trillium, like red trillium, has three mottled, leaflike bracts and a single, sessile, upright flower. Woodland red trillium, however, is somewhat taller, often growing to about fifteen inches in height, and has larger bracts and larger flowers with strongly reflexed sepals, a feature noted in its specific epithet. The flowers of the Trillium recurvatum lack the strong, unpleasant, carrionlike odor of red trillium. Woodland red trillium has petals that bow outward in the middle and anthers that curve inward. This species grows more abundantly in Illinois and Indiana and reaches the southern limit of its geographic range in northern Louisiana, where it has been recorded from about seven parishes. Trillium is a genus mostly of temperate areas. Approximately forty of its fifty species grow in North America; the remainders are found in Asia. The genus is traditionally divided into two groups: one with stalked flowers, the other with stalkless flowers. Four of the five species, native to Louisiana, belong to the latter group."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 118	LILIACEAE	Lily Family	April 4, 1984	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-12	1989	Tangipahoa Parish	1976-1989	"Although small in stature and deceptively attractive, the insectivorous yellow butterwort must seem like a menacing monster to a variety of insects. Glandular hairs secrete a viscous fluid that entraps and subsequently digests small creatures that alight on the plant's leaves. The leaf margins roll upward-a mechanism that seems to aid this plant's eating habits. Insectivory provides yellow butterwort with nutrients and is a means of survival in its native habitat, the nutrient-poor, wet pine savannas and bogs of the coastal plain from extreme southeastern Louisiana eastward to North Carolina and Florida. Flowers of this species, which are held about six inches above its rosette are large and showy and are characterized by a large, nectar-secreting spur petal. If provided with appropriate light and moisture conditions, yellow butterwort can be propagated from seeds and planted in the garden."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 103	LENTIBULARIACEAE	Bladderwort Family	March 13, 1977	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-12	1989	East Feliciana Parish	1976-1989	"Yellow candy root (left) normally develops a basal rosette of blunt-tipped leaves from which several ascending to upright stems arise. The branch apices terminate in dense clusters of lemon yellow flowers. Of the five sepals composing the calyx, two are considerably larger than the other three and are petal-like. Its corolla is fused along two-thirds its length and bears a lobed crest. An aril, a fleshy appendage typical of the candy root, is seen on the shiny, black seeds of this species. Polygala nana has somewhat the same appearance as the orange candy root, but it is shorter, a fact noted by the specific epithet nana, meaning "dwarf." Yellow candy root grows in wet, sandy soils of bogs and pine savannas and blooms throughout the summer. Although many are attractive wildflowers, species in Polygala are of limited economic importance. Snake root (P. senega) of eastern North America has been used by the Seneca Indians as a cure for snakebites."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 190	POLYGALACEAE	Milkwort Family	April 2, 1982	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-20	1989	Washington Parish	1976-1989	"Although yellow fringed orchid is known to exist in a number of localities throughout much of Louisiana, it is nevertheless uncommon. This species grows mainly in bogs and wet pine savannas, where its apricot-colored flowers dot the late-summer landscape. Roots of this plant are tuberous, and each plant typically develops a single, upright stem with two to four glossy green leaves. From thirty to sixty flowers compose the terminal racemes. As with most orchids, flowers of the yellow fringed orchid have three sepals and three petals. The cup-shaped dorsal sepal nearly conceals the tiny, fringed, lateral petals, and the other two sepals project laterally from the flower's center. Like the white fringed orchid, this species has flowers that bear a long, curved spur and an intricately fringed, tongue-shaped lip. Nectar secreted within the spur mainly attracts swallowtail butterflies, the plant's principal pollinator."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 160	ORCHIDACEAE	Orchid Family	August 22, 1980	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Black titi often forms dense stands. Its rounded form is created by many-branched twigs that bear numerous dark green, leathery, shiny, mostly evergreen leaves. One to several racemes of flowers appear in the late spring from near the branch tips that were formed in the previous season. Petal color may vary from white, which is the most common, to pink.

Its racemes of golden yellow flowers appear from mid-to late summer, and they are conical in the bud stage and cylindrical when in flower. Unlike the fringed orchids, this plant has a floral lip with a margin that is merely scalloped, and the specific name integra describes this condition. The lateral sepals spread at right angles to the lip and to the dorsal sepal, which arches over and surrounds the lateral petals and the column of the flower. Yellow fringeless orchid closely resembles Platanthera cristata, the crested orchid, which grows in similar habitats. Yellow fringeless orchid is known to grow in only four or five locations in Louisiana. It is one of the many rare species of plants that grow in boglike habitats, giving additional support to their significance as a home for unusual flora."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 153	ORCHIDACEAE	Orchid Family	July 16, 1989	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

The unusual yellow, pouchlike slipper is formed by the lower petal, or lip, which differs considerably from the other two lance-shaped, spirally twisted, purple-brown petals. Contained within the slipper is the column, composed of two functional stamens, the stigma, and the style. The three sepals are similar in color to the lateral petals but are broader. Three to five pleated leaves are supported on stems that may reach two feet tall. Until recently, the yellow lady's slippers in the eastern United States had been called Cypripedium calceolus, but investigations suggest that the plants found from Louisiana to Kentucky make up a distinct species that should be called C. kentuckiense.

Libraries	2006-08-12	1989	Tangipahoa Parish	1976-1989	"The yellow pitcher plant is a colorful and unusual plant found in bogs and wet savannas. Pitcher plants are carnivorous, i.e., they are capable of 'trapping' and digesting insects and small animals. Their remarkable, funnel-like leaves are well adapted to attract and entrap prey. Provided with nectar glands and intricate patterns of bright coloration, they lure insects into the pitchers. A slippery surface around the mouth of the pitcher causes small creatures to lose their footing and fall inside the leaf. Downward-pointing hairs lining the pitcher's inner surface inhibit prey from escaping. The lid, reflexed over the top of its tubular leaf, does not snap down to entrap small animals, contrary to popular belief, but seems to prevent rainwater from diluting the digestive enzymes inside. Flowers of the yellow pitcher plant occur singly at the apices of long, leafless, nodding scapes. Each flower possesses three bracts, five small sepals, five pendulous, bright yellow petals, and numerous stamens. The large, inverted, umbrella-like style, unique to pitcher plants, encourages cross-pollination by forming passageways for insects to enter and leave the flower."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 178	SARRACENIACEAE	Pitcher Plant Family	March 30, 1977 (flowers); April 12, 1977 (leaves)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-31	1989	Tangipahoa Parish	1976-1989	"Yellow pond lily commonly grows in the shallow, sluggish water of bayous, ditches, ponds, and swamps of Louisiana and the eastern United States. Extensive rhizomes serve to firmly anchor the plants to the mud of such habitats. Their dark green, broadly oval leaf blades may vary in length from ten to twenty inches, and petioles two to three times as long secure them to the rhizome. The leaves may be immersed in water, float on its surface, or emerge from it. Submerged leaves, however, have a generally thinner and somewhat more crisped blades than do emergent ones. Typically, the golden yellow flowers, which float on or just below the water's surface, are tethered to the rhizome by long peduncles. Six or more rather fleshy, concave, petal-like sepals composed the perianth, which subtends the numerous stamens. The compound ovary forms a many-seeded fruit. Even though these plants are called lilies, they are very distantly related; in fact, they are not monocots but dicots."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 146	NYMPHAEACEAE	Water Lily Family	May 12, 1982	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-24	1989	Bossier Parish	1976-1989	"Referring to this species as a grass is clearly a misnomer. Although leaves of this plant are long and grasslike, its large yellow flowers place it in the amaryllis family or, according to some, in its own family, the Hypoxidaceae. The densely hairy leaves of this stemless plant arise from a cormlike rhizome often buried deep within the soil. On well-established plants, several flowering stalks, each with numerous flowers, are produced. Its perianth is indeed starlike, with six well-spaced, bright yellow segments. The stamens also number six, and the three-parted pistil within the flower matures into a capsule with many, rather rough, black, shiny seeds.

This species is characterized by horizontal, underwater stems and large, disk-shaped leaf blades that rise above the water on long, stout stalks. Its solitary, showy, yellow flowers are about six to ten inches in diameter and are composed of numerous perianth parts and spirally inserted stamens. Featured within the flower's center is an enlarged receptacle with several pistils partially embedded in it. At maturity, the receptacle, with its nutlike fruits, becomes brown and woody and is often used in dried-flower arrangements. Its underwater stems are edible, and so are its seeds, which may be eaten--raw or boiled--at an immature or mature stage. Yellow lotus may be cultivated for its attractive flowers and fruits. Nelumbo nucifera, the ornamentally grown sacred lotus of the Old World, is characterized by pink flowers and is occasionally seen in the wild."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 134	NYMPHAEACEAE	Water Lily Family	September 5, 1982	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Unlike the other native blue irises, this one is short, growing to about two feet. It is further characterized by its slender, underground rhizome and its numerous leaves that overtop the flowers. The large, attractive flowers of this species have deep blue to purple perianth parts and generally occur singly on short stalks that arise from near each leaf base. The sepals are large with yellowish crests; the petals are slightly smaller, generally upright, and lack crests. The plant's fruiting capsules are about one to two inches long and contain numerous seeds. Iris brevicaulis grows from eastern Texas to Alabama and northward to Kansas and Ohio.

Libraries	2006-08-12	1989	Lincoln Parish	1976-1989	"Rich woodlands at higher latitudes of eastern North America abound with this representative of the poppy family that flowers in early spring. Northern Louisiana, where only a few populations of bloodroot are known, represents the southernmost point in the geographic range of this northern plant. The delicate nature of bloodroot offers several admirable qualities from the time its palmately divided, blue-green leaves unfold and its short-lived flowers drop their many creamy white petals until the formation of its narrowly elliptic, upright capsules. Both its generic and its common names denote the reddish sap profusely exuded by injured rhizomes. During the past few years, Sanguinaria has practically become a household word because of the discovery of a substance from its roots that, when used as a toothpaste additive, helps control dental plaque. Bloodroot is an interesting ornamental if planted in a natural wooded setting. The Papaveraceae, a family of about 250 species of mostly north temperate distribution, includes many popular ornamentals such as prickly poppies and the California poppies. The many alkaloids produced by the opium poppy, P. somniferum, are of great medicinal value."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 155	PAPAVERACEAE	Poppy Family	March 5, 1984 (flowers); March 14, 1984 (fruit)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Although the flowers lack petals, they are nevertheless attractive because of the four rather fleshy, petal-like sepals, which have attenuate, upturned tips. Within the calyces are numerous stamens and pistils, which form rather long-tailed fruits. Blue jasmine has opposite, pinnately compound leaves with three to five leaflets. This perennial herbaceous vine is worthy of cultivation for its attractive, unusual flowers. A number of other interesting and colorful leather flowers grow in Louisiana and adjacent states. For example, C. texensis of central Texas is a species with scarlet flowers.

The flowers have unusual, colorful, petal-like sepals; the upper one forms a long spur in which nectar is produced. The petals are much smaller and less showy, and the upper two may also form spurs that fit inside the spur of the upper sepal. The ovary is three-parted, and at maturity, each segment forms an upright follicle containing many seeds. Blue larkspur is a perennial found throughout the southeastern United States. In Louisiana, it may grow abundantly in very restricted, specialized habitats such as the calcareous prairie openings that dot the north-central part of this state. Delphinium, with approximately two hundred species, is a diverse genus primarily of the Northern Hemisphere.

This species is frequently seen in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, but appears to be rare or absent elsewhere in the state. A short, tuber-bearing rhizome anchors the plant to the mud in relatively shallow water. Its floating, orbicular to broadly oval-shaped leaf blades are dark green above and may be red to purple beneath, and they resemble those of the more common white water lily. The faintly fragrant flowers of blue water lily are generally supported above the water and have several pale blue petals that intensify in color when dried. In typical water lily fashion, the central part of the flower contains many yellow stamens. Numerous small seeds are formed in the somewhat-globose capsules.

Libraries	2006-09-16	1989	West Feliciana Parish	1976-1989	"Growing in many-stemmed clumps in meadows and pastures and along roadsides, blue-eyed grass creates colorful springtime floral vistas. The ephemeral flowers, usually lasting a day or part of a day, are arranged in umbrella-like clusters and arise from between a pair of bracts called spathes. The perianth has a yellow center, or eye, and is composed of six petal-like, blue-violet members, each with a small point. Although several species of Sisyrinchium are indigenous to Louisiana, knowledge of their taxonomy is poor, making the application of correct names difficult. Some of the species are rather weedy, small annuals with white, yellow, or dingy violet flowers. Indeed, the name blue-eyed grass is misleading not only because the flower color varies but also because this species is not a grass but a member of the iris family. This plant's relation to the irises is supported by details of its floral structure: the six perianth members, three stamens, and inferior ovary."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 100	IRIDACEAE	Iris Family	April 17, 1979	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

In late spring and summer, spikes of small, bluish flowers of the bluehearts commonly appear among the diverse flora of the wet pine savannas of the coastal plain of Louisiana and the Southeast. As many as six flowers may appear on each spike; each flower is composed of five, somewhat-unequal petals. Along the stems, which may attain a height of two feet, are several pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The number of veins in the leaves is an important characteristic in distinguishing between the two species of bluehearts, which may grow in mixed colonies. American bluehearts (right) have single-veined lower leaves, and the Florida bluehearts (left) have three-veined lower leaves. The genus Buchnera contains about one hundred species, which mostly inhabit the Old World tropics and subtropics." -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p. 202.

Libraries	2006-10-07	1989	St. Tammany Parish	1976-1989	"Bog camas has a bulbous base covered with a fibrous coat formed from the bases of previous leaves. Its several, long, tapering, grasslike leaves rise from near ground level. Except for a few bracts, the flower stalk, which grows to about three feet tall, is leafless. The flowers, compactly arranged in branching racemes, are nearly one-half inch across. Each has a six creamy white to greenish perianth segments bearing a darker yellow spot and one or two basal glands (a feature alluded to by the generic name). The lower flowers of the inflorescence are functionally bisexual and form capsular fruits. The upper flowers contain either stamens alone or stamens and nonfunctional pistils. Bog camas inhabits wet, sandy, pine savannas and bogs mostly in the coastal plain of the southeastern United States. This plant is rare in Louisiana, reported only from St. Tammany Parish. Zigadenus contains approximately fifteen species that are commonly called camas because of their similarity to another liliaceous genus, Camassia. The foliage and roots of Zigadenus are reported to be toxins to sheep and other grazing animals, and the nectar of the flowers is said to contain poisonous alkaloids. There are some reports of humans being poisoned after camas bulbs were mistakenly consumed as onions."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 140	LILIACEAE	Lily Family	May 1, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Bog sunflower is primarily a Gulf Coastal Plain perennial that inhabits wet pine savannas and flatwoods. In Louisiana, it is known to grow in three southeastern parishes. Flower heads, which appear in late summer, are about two inches across and consist of numerous yellow rays and many purple disk flowers. Several long, lance-shaped leaves form a basal rosette. The leaves progressively become much reduced and more widely spaced up the stem.

Like most other Sagittaria, it has basal, erect leaves and is monoecious, with staminate and pistillate flowers on the flowering scape. In broad-leaved bulltongue, the inflorescence is overtopped by the unlobed, elliptic to ovate leaves. This feature, along with the recurved stalks of the fruiting heads, serves to distinguish this species from other Sagittaria. Sagittaria graminea, another common species found in similar habitats and sometimes including S. platyphylla at the varietal level, differs in having ascending to spreading, fruiting stalks. The generic name Sagittaria refers to the arrowhead-shaped leaves characteristic of some species. The water plantain family embraces only about one hundred species.

Dense clusters of various shades of brilliant orange flowers bloom from the ends of numerous branches of this rather low-growing, weak-stemmed plant. A cloak of coarse hairs gives the leafy stems a rough texture. Unlike most milkweeds, this species does not produce a milky latex. Perhaps the common name has been given to this plant because butterflies are attracted to the copious nectar of the flowers or because from some distance the flowers give the appearance of clouds of orange butterflies hovering near the ground. Butterfly weed is a popular garden ornamental. Its large-branched taproot, however, makes transplanting a futile exercise.

Libraries	2006-07-27	1989	Lafourche Parish	1976-1989	"The richness of its vivid scarlet flowers indeed rivals that of a cardinal's breeding plumage. One of our most recognized wildflowers, cardinal flower generally grows along streams in moist, shady woods. The two-lipped flowers are borne on upright racemes that appear in late summer and fall. Projecting from the two-lobed upper lip and surrounding the style is a collar of five purplish anthers. Such a configuration places the pollen in a position where it can be deposited on the heads of hummingbirds and butterflies as they collect nectar from within the corollas; the pollen is then transferred to other flowers. Because of its increasing rarity, cardinal flower should never be transplanted from the wild. It can be readily propagated from seeds or stem cuttings. Once the cardinal flower is established in the garden, its side shoots, which develop at the base of the current season's withering stem, must not be covered by fallen leaves or mulch. These new shoots must receive sunlight in order to live and produce the following year's growth."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 49	CAMPANULACEAE	Bellflower Family	June 1, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

The small, grape-sized, berrylike drupes are at first red and then black. Because the drupes mature at different times, various colors are typically present in each cluster. Flowers of this species are rather small and five-merous with yellowish green petals. Their bright green color, elliptical shape, and prominent veins make Carolina buckthorn leaves attractive and distinctive. Found throughout the southeastern United States, this species grows in the understory and at the borders of rich, moist, deciduous woodlands. The largest individual tree is reported to be nearly fifty feet tall; most trees, however, rarely attain thirty feet. Although little used as a landscape plant, Carolina buckthorn has considerable potential for this purpose.

The species is common throughout most of Louisiana and the southeastern United States. Its high-climbing habit, earlier flowering period, and delicately scented flowers distinguish Carolina jessamine from the similar swamp jessamine. Carolina jessamine is a popular garden ornamental often grown on trellises, fences, and mailbox posts. In direct sun, the plant forms a more compact habit and flowers more abundantly. The species is readily propagated from seeds, cuttings, and divisions. Its epithet sempervirens means "evergreen." Alkaloids contained in the roots, leaves, and nectar are toxic and may cause poisoning if consumed. Carolina jessamine reportedly was introduced into England in 1640 and illustrated in that year by John Parkinson in his Theatrum Botanicum ( http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&res_id=xri:eebo&rft_id=xri:eebo:image:22703) ."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 141	LOGANIACEAE	Logania Family	March 10, 1977	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

It frequently grows on remote, dry hillsides accessible to only the most determined naturalists. This majestic native species is as spectacular as its domestic counterparts but is less well known. One to four flamboyant, but gracefully nodding, purple-spotted, reddish orange to yellow flowers with six rich, rusty stamens are borne on stems one to four feet tall. Leaves of the Carolina lily are arranged in whorls, with each of the one to three whorls consisting of three to seven leaves. Much smaller and less numerous leaves characterize the upper part of the stem. Beneath the ground, scores of bulblets are produced, and each has the potential to grow into a new plant. The scientific name for this species commemorates Andre Michaux, an eighteenth-century French botanist and explorer of North America, whose collections first made this plant known to science."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 114	LILIACEAE	Lily Family	July 24, 1984	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Carolina moonseed is dioecious. Its attractive fruits appear only on the female plants and result from clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers. Pollen plants produce similarly small, but more ephemeral, flowers containing only stamens. The simple, alternate leaves are palmately veined and vary in shape from triangular to ovate. Their lower surfaces generally are densely pubescent. Tendrils are lacking on this plant, which twines as its means of support."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.145	MENISPERMACEAE	Moonseed Family	October 18, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-09-23	1989	Iberville Parish	1976-1989	"Typically a shrub, or occasionally reaching tree size, American snowbell grows in moist to wet habitats with standing water, such as swamps and wet woodlands. This species differs from the big leaf snowbell in a number of features besides habitat preference. The leaves of American snowbell are somewhat smaller, and its pendulous flowers occur singly or in pairs in the axils of the leaves and at the tips of short branches. Like those of its sister species, American snowbell flowers have recurved tips and ten yellow stamens closely clustered around the downward-pointing style. This species possesses double buds at each node. It appears to be more tolerant of different soils, and if planted in a somewhat sunny location, it will flower abundantly. Propagation of this plant is somewhat difficult but normally is achieved by germinating seeds or by air-layering branches. American snowbell is fairly common throughout Louisiana."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 204	STYRACACEAE	Storax Family	April 7, 1980	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-12	1989	Caldwell Parish	1976-1989	"Delicate, pink flowers grace the branch tips of the shrubby Carolina rose. Arising from underground runners, its sparingly branched stems are generally armed with a few to many somewhat-hooked prickles. In typical roselike fashion, leaves of the Carolina rose are pinnately compound with five to seven leaflets. Unlike most cultivated forms, the wild roses each have but a single whorl of five petals that open at right angels to the flower's axis. Each petal is somewhat heart-shaped and varies in color from pink at the tip to white at the base. Forming the center of the flower are numerous yellow stamens and style branches. The hip, which is composed of the floral cup surrounding the achenes, is red at maturity with persistent reflexed sepals. Carolina rose is one of the natives worthy of cultivation. It requires full sun and well-drained soil. It is widespread in eastern North America, and it was first described by Linnaeus from plants collected in the Carolinas."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 197	ROSACEAE	Rose Family	May 4, 1982	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Preference for wet alkaline of saline soils may be a factor restricting its distribution. This annual species commonly grows to two feet tall, and its evenly spaced, obovate pairs of leaves clasp the stems. Both the stems and the leaves are covered with a waxy substance that gives the plants a bluish color. In summer, large, showy, bell-shaped flowers open from spindle-shaped buds produced singly form the tips of long pedicels.

Libraries	2006-07-31	1989	Bossier Parish	1976-1989	"The sky blue flowers of the celestial lily usually occur in pairs, as suggested by its specific epithet geminiflora, which means "twin flower." The generic name Nemastylis is Greek and refers to the six slender, threadlike style branches arising from the central part of the flower. Although spectacular, the flowers are ephemeral and can be seen only from midmorning until they fade a few hours later. Its flower stalks, which grow to two feet in height, arise from an underground bulb and support two to three narrow, pleated leaves. This plant is a member of the iris family and is not a lily, as suggested by its common name. Celestial lily, found in open woods and prairies from central Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama northward to Kansas and Missouri, appears to be uncommon in the wild. This plant has received little attention as an ornamental plant, but it probably would be suitable for the native plant garden. The genus Nemastylis contains three other species found in the southern United States and another in Mexico."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 88	IRIDACEAE	Iris Family	April 22, 1983	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Because of its aggressive growth habits, it may form impenetrable thickets. Coral greenbriar has stems that are much less spiny than those of some of its relatives. Blades of its leaves are green above and somewhat paler below, ovate to lanceolate-ovate in outline, and supported by short, usually reddish petioles. Species of Smilax are dioecious, i.e., pollen-producing and fruit-bearing flowers occur on different individuals. Both types of flowers are produced in umbels on stalks arising from the axils of the leaves. Their perianths are composed of six greenish yellow, petal-like segments; the staminate flowers have six stamens, and the pistillate flowers have a single, three-parted pistil. Its bright red berries persist on the plant and reach maturity after leaf fall in autumn. Nearly a dozen species of Smilax grow in Louisiana, and several, such as catbriar, greenbriar, and bullbriar, have numerous, very sharp spines, grow in great abundance, and may make a hike in the woods an unpleasant experience."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 107	LILIACEAE	Lily Family	September 4, 1982	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-19	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Cow oak is common deciduous forest tree of the rich, mesic slopes and river bottom forests subject to floods of short duration. The bark of its straight, upright trunk is light gray and shaggy, somewhat like that of white oak. Leaves of cow oak, which clearly place it in the chestnut oak group, are usually six to eight inches long and have about a dozen large teeth along each edge and several evenly spaced, secondary veins running from the midvein to the margin. Flowers of both sexes occur on the same tree. The staminate flowers form dense, drooping catkins, and the seed-producing ones are borne singly or in small clusters. Relatively large acorns with caps about one-half their length mature in one season. Cow oak is a desirable shade tree and timber species. Because the wood splits evenly into thin strips, it is used for basket-making and for shingles. Late in the season, the leaves of cow oak become red, and it is one of the few species in the Deep South to dependably provide autumn coloration. The scientific name for this species has been the source of confusion over the years. Quercus prinus, a name often used for cow oak, is no longer in use."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 76	FABACEAE	Beech Family	March 9, 1981 (flowers); April 14, 1981 (leaves); October 16, 1981 (acorn)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

In autumn, as the trees begin to lose their leaves and more sunlight reaches the forest floor, the crane fly orchid develops a new leaf and corm from its underground tubers. Typically three to four inches long, this solitary leaf is deep green above, a rich, satiny purple below. It lives until the next spring, when it withers and eventually dies. By late summer, following a period of dormancy, the inflorescence emerges, and the upper two-thirds of its leafless axis are occupied with flowers. Their perianth parts are colored with various shades of green and purple. Its three sepals and two of its petals are similar in size and shape, while the lip is three-lobed and possesses a basal spur about one inch long. The flowers, handing askew on the inflorescence, resemble crane flies. In fact, the orchid name is based on the generic name for crane flies. Within a large population of leaves, only a few inflorescences are seen each year, suggesting that individual plants flower infrequently."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 162	ORCHIDACEAE	Orchid Family	August 24, 1982	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

This plant is a saprophyte, i.e., its organic nutrients are derived not from photosynthesis but from the rich, humic soils in which it grows. Having adopted this mode of nutrition, crested coral-root exhibits a syndrome of unusual adaptations. It has no need for large leaves; instead, the plant has reduced, scalelike bracts along its yellowish brown to purple stem. Living in shady, moist habitats has apparently reduced the plant's need for large amounts of water and, consequently, has resulted in its loss of roots. It develops fleshy, succulent rhizomes underground. Atop its upright stems, which may be as tall as three feet, spikes of from five to twenty-five gaudily decorated flowers typically appear midsummer or later. The color of its sepals and petals ranges from yellow to yellow-brown, and they are purple striped. Five fleshy crests characterize the enlarged lip of this species."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 151			August 24, 1982 (flowers); September 21, 1982 (fruit)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-10-07	1989	Tangipahoa Parish	1976-1989	"American wisteria is a deciduous, woody, twining vine that grows in wet soil along streams, ponds, and bayous. The alternate, pinnately compound leaves of this species are normally composed of from nine to fifteen leaflets. Conical, pendulous racemes up to ten inches long develop after the leaves have matured. Flowering begins at the base of the inflorescence and then progresses toward its apex. A five-lobed calyx surrounds the bilaterally symmetric corolla, which is made up of five bluish to lilac petals. The largest petal is the broadly elliptical banner, which projects at right angles to the pair of wing petals surrounding the two petals of the keel. Enclosed by the keel is one free stamen and nine others fused by their filaments. The ovary forms a many-seeded, legume-like fruit that may be several inches long. Although not in common use, American wisteria is an exceedingly attractive vine suitable for growing on fences and arbors. The commonly grown, more aggressive Asian wisterias flower before, or simultaneously with, new leaf development and they have somewhat different fruits."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 93	FABACEAE	Legume Family	April 24, 1980 (flowers); April 26, 1980 (fruit)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

It may become a large tree, achieving a height of about seventy-five feet and a trunk diameter of more than three feet. Like other magnolias, its leaves are simple and alternate, but deciduous-unlike those of southern magnolia, which are evergreen. Flowers of the cucumber magnolia appear in early spring just as the new leaves begin to unfold. Their typically nine, pale, greenish yellow perianth parts are slender and arch gracefully upward. Many short-lived, spirally attached stamens lie between the perianth and the numerous pistils. Each flower forms a conelike aggregate fruit that is somewhat cucumber-shaped. Cucumber magnolia is a desirable, but seldom used, ornamental shade tree that has a form somewhat like that of the tulip tree."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 142	MAGNOLIACEAE	Magnolia Family	April 1, 1981 (flowers); August 17, 1978 (fruit)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Functionally, deciduous holly plants are dioecious, i.e., individuals produce either pollen or fruit. Flowers appear in the spring either singly or in small clusters in the axils of new leaves. Both pollen- and seed-bearing flowers have four to five small, yellowish green petals. When fully developed, the alternate simple leaves of this species are generally broadest above the middle and have a few small teeth along their margins. Late in the season, after the leaves have fallen and throughout the winter months, persistent, spherical red fruits give deciduous holly high visibility. Several horticultural selections with various shades of fruit color are available for ornamental plantings."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 18	AQUIFOLIACEAE	Holly Family	April 14, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Devilwood appears to be restricted in Louisiana to the Florida Parishes, and it is rather common in certain localities. This generally small tree reportedly can grow to nearly forty feet tall with a trunk diameter approaching two feet. Like sweet olive, its leathery leaves are opposite and simple. The flowers of devilwood are contained in small, scaly bracted, branched clusters, and though not as fragrant, they are similar to those of sweet olive in size and construction. Devilwood flowers are polygamous, meaning that bisexual and unisexual flowers are produced on the same plant. Fruits of devilwood are purplish drupes similar in appearance to small olives.

Each of the five sepal lobes tapers to a narrow point. The lavender to purple petals are fused into a long, slender tube that abruptly flares into five broad, flattened lobes. Within the corolla tube and attached to it at different levels are the five tiny stamens. Their capsular fruits contain numerous, tiny seeds.

Libraries	2006-07-31	1989	West Feliciana Parish	1976-1989	"The elliptic to obovate, flattened pads of the prickly pear are modified stems. Branches are represented by the clusters of spines that arise from the regularly spaced nodes, called areoles, of the stem. Also associated with the circular areoles are hairlike, often barbed spines called glochids, which will lodge in the skin, causing considerable irritation. Leaves of the eastern prickly pear may subtend each node and are tiny, short-lived, often triangular-shaped bits of tissue. Flowers of the prickly pear are produced around the upper margins of the pads. Their bright, lemon yellow perianth segments are about one and one-half inches long and surround masses of showy stamens. Fruits of this and of most species of cactus are edible. However, they need to be singed to remove the glochids. Although not common in Louisiana, the eastern prickly pear grows in dry, sandy soils and dunes sometimes associated with streams."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 40	CACTACEAE	Cactus Family	May 11, 1982 (flowers); August 31, 1982 (fruit)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-18	1989	St. Tammany Parish	1976-1989	"Although fairy wand occurs widely throughout the eastern United States, it is quite rare in Louisiana, where only a few plants have been found on a few rich, wooded hillsides. This member of the lily family develops a basal rosette of leaves and, at flowering, produces elongated flowering stalks with reduced leaves. Each of the numerous flowers is composed of six petal-like perianth parts. Pollen- and seed-producing flowers grow on separate plants. Pollen plants appear every year, while seed-producing ones may flower every two or three years. The name devil's bit seems inappropriate for this elegant woodland wildflower.

Libraries	2006-07-21	1989	Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England	1976-1989	"The annual sunflower is one of the most familiar of all flowering plants. It commonly grows along roadsides and around the edges of fields and woodlands. During the fall, the plant becomes conspicuous because of its large heads of flowers that resemble the sun. In fact, its generic name is derived from the Greek words helios, meaning "sun," and anthos, meaning "flower"; the specific epithet denotes the plant's annual habit. The head of the sunflower is a cluster of many small flowers of two types. Ray flowers, with their long, strap-shaped corollas, surround the margin of the head. They produce no pollen or fruit but serve to attract insect pollinators. In the center of the head are the disk flowers; these have radially symmetrical corollas and function to produce pollen and seed. Archaeological evidence suggests that the annual sunflower had been domesticated by various American Indian cultures; it is the only native plant species domesticated in what is now the United States. On a world wide scale, the sunflower is second to the soybean as the most important source of vegetable oil."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 30	ASTERACEAE	Sunflower Family	July 9, 1976	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-09-16	1989	Franklin County, Mississippi	1976-1989	"Vivid, crimson, star-shaped flowers up to two inches across are the outstanding feature of the fire pink. Its five petals arise above the cylindrical calyx tube, and where the petals flare out at right angles, they each possess two small appendages. Because of a prominent notch at their apices, the petals appear to be more numerous than they are. Normally, ten stamens and three styles are seen in the perfect flowers of Silene virginica. This short-lived perennial has a few pairs of opposite stem leaves and a basal rosette of leaves that often disappears by the flowering period. Fire pink is most common in the mountains and piedmont of the southeastern United States and reaches its western limit in northern Louisiana. Another crimson-flowered species, S. subciliata, occurs in a few parishes in southwestern Louisiana. Silene is related to the commercially popular carnation, Dianthus caryphllus, and to baby's breath, a species of Gypsophila. Other well-known plants in the pink family are the nearly cosmopolitan weeds, chickweed and mouse-eared chickweed."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 60	CARYOPHYLLACEAE	Pink Family	March 29, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Chickasaw plum (Prunus angustifolia) is a similar native species, but several features offer useful diagnostic markets. The small teeth along the margins of Chickasaw plum leaves are tipped with red or yellow glands, and those of flatwoods plum are glandless. One bite of the fruit will readily identify the species. Flatwoods plum fruit are very bitter and distasteful, while the other species has tart, pleasant-tasting plums. Both species would provide interesting ornamental accent plants.

Sophisticated traps attached on short stalks along the branches are adapted to catch very small animals. The traps are tiny, sacklike structures in which develops negative pressure, caused by the activities of associated glands. A small insect or crustacean swimming near the entrance to the trap will brush against the several bristles, stimulating a flap of tissue-the door-that guards the entrance to open suddenly. Water flows into the trap, sweeping the animal with it. The door closes, entrapping the tiny creature, which is subsequently digested. Floating bladderwort grows in shallow ponds and ditches in the coastal plain of the Southeast. From its base radiate several branches with swollen stalks and midribs that function as flotation devices supporting the flower stalks. Located along the branches are the numerous traps. Its inflorescence consists of from five to fifteen flowers. The corollas are golden yellow, spurred, and two-lipped, and the lower lip is often streaked or dotted with red."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.110	LENTIBULARIACEAE	Bladderwort Family	March 23, 1982	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Umbel-like clusters of flowers arise from the juncture of the rhizome with the petiole, and late in the season, several fleshy roots may also form at this point. Although floating hearts and water lilies have leaves that are similar in appearance, their small, white, cup-shaped, floating flowers are quite different. Rather than having many separate parts typical of the water lilies, floating hearts have sepals, petals, and stamens that number five each. Their fruits are thin-walled, two-parted capsules with many seeds. This remarkably distinctive, aquatic, coastal plain plant is restricted to about the southern one-third of Louisiana.

Two important provisions for growing flowering dogwoods are semishaded conditions and well-drained soils."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 66	CORNACEAE	Dogwood Family	April 3, 1978 (flowers); October, 1978 (fruit)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Stones, Margaret	1976	Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, La.). Libraries	2006-09-16	1989	St. Mary Parish	1976-1989	"When he named this plant in 1834, Thomas Nuttal referred to it as the largest and finest Spiranthes in the United States, a distinction it still holds. Fragrant ladies' tresses grow in wet woods, marshes, and wet prairies from Texas to Virginia. Its narrowly oblanceolate leaves are mostly borne along the lower half of its slender stems, which may attain heights of three feet. According to some observers, its creamy white flowers, which are arranged in several vertical ranks, have a vanilla-like fragrance that intensifies during the evening hours. Each flower, subtended by a floral bract, is composed of three sepals that resemble the two upper petals. The lower petal is modified into the larger, reflexed lip and has a yellowish center and a somewhat crenulate margin. Within the connivent perianth parts is the column composed of the modified anthers, the stigma, and the style. Spiranthes, a genus of about two hundred species, is widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, tropical Asia, and Chile. Approximately ten other species have been reported for Louisiana."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 154	ORCHIDACEAE	Orchid Family	October 23, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-10	1989	Tangipahoa Parish	1976-1989	"Except for having green leaves rather than variously colored ones, arrow arum somewhat resembles its relative, the commonly cultivated caladium. Both plants have arrowhead-shaped blades supported on long petioles. Under favorable conditions, arrow arum may grow to three feet in height from a tuberouslike rhizome. Its unisexual flowers are borne on a specialized inflorescence called a spadix. Both types of flowers are small and lack sepals and petals. The female flowers are located near the base of the inflorescence axis and essentially consist only of a pistil. Represented by tiny, shield-shaped scales each supporting four to eight anthers, the pollen-bearing flowers occupy the apical part of the axis. The generic name is descriptive of this plant's peculiar, shield-shaped anther supports. Surrounding the spadix is a leaflike bract called a spathe, which may range from green to yellowish in color. At maturity, the berrylike fruits may remain green or turn brown. Arrow arum is also related to jack-in-the-pulpit, green dragon, and golden club."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 5	ARACEAE	Arum Family	April 30, 1982	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Each plant consists of a rosette of nearly heart-shaped leaf blades supported by relatively long petioles. Spongy, air-filled tissue composes the leaves, increases the plat's buoyancy, and facilitates gas exchange with the atmosphere. As a means of vegetative propagation, the plant develops runners upon which plantlets are formed. Seeds are also produced in the female flowers of this monoecious species. Both the staminate and the pistillate flowers possess three sepals and three petals. The flowers appear one at a time in the leaf axils. Six to twelve stamens with fused filaments characterize the male flower while the female is recognizable by its typically six, deeply divided stigmas and its inferior ovary, which forms a berrylike fruit."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 96	HYDROCHARITACEAE	Frog's Bit Family	August 29, 1983	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-07-24	1989	Cameron Parish	1976-1989	"Giant blue-flag inhabits the swamps and marshes from Louisiana and southeastern Texas to Florida. Growing to six feet in height, it is the tallest of our iris species. Except for being larger, its flowers are similar to our other irises. The expanded blades of three sepals are colored a rich purple, while the narrowed basal portion, the claw, is yellowish green with darker lines. A central, yellow crest extends from the claw onto the base of the expanded blade. Its three petals are similar to the sepals but slightly smaller. Like the other species of Iris, giant blue-flag has been a favored subject for flower gardens. In the past, numerous color forms and natural interspecific hybrids grew in great profusion in Louisiana, but changing land use and intensive collecting have resulted in the demise of such colorful vistas. Some investigators maintain that Florida and Louisiana populations of giant blue-flag represent a single species whose correct name is I. hexagona. Others suggest that the Louisiana populations are a different species properly called I. giganticaerulea. Additional research should help resolve this controversy."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 99	IRIDACEAE	Iris Family	April 25, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

This member of the sunflower family has crowded, alternate, lanceolate leaves along its unbranched, upright stem that may grow to twelve feet tall. Its branching inflorescence, like that of other members of this plant family, contains many heads composed of numerous individual flowers. In the case of giant ironweed, only disk flowers with radially symmetric, five-lobed corollas occur in the heads. Attached immediately outside the corolla's base are numerous bristlelike structures, collectively called the pappus, which function in dispersing the attached fruit. Giant ironweed and some of its relatives, because of their aggressive growth characteristics, tend to become weedy in pastures that are overgrazed and may be indicators of abusive land practices. Vernonia, a genus of about a thousand species, is most diverse in South America and Africa. Approximately eighteen species are known from the eastern United States, and four of these grow in Louisiana."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 46	ASTERACEAE	Sunflower Family	October 9, 1979	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Its bluish green, elliptical leaves may float on the water's surface or emerge above it. Water beads up on the leaves' surface, and leaves removed from water appear to be dry. For this reason, golden club is sometimes called by the common name "never wet."

lsu-sc-msw:77	Grass Pink Orchid	Calopogon tuberosus (L.) B.S.P.	Murry, Robert E., Jr.	Stones, Margaret	1976	Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, La.). Libraries	2006-03-31	1989	Vernon Parish	1976-1989	"'Gift of the meadow' is the meaning of Limodorum, a Greek name first used for this plant that grows in sunny wet meadows and savannas. This little orchid with its rose-pink to nearly crimson flowers is truly a jewel. The lip, one of the specialized petals of the orchid flower, is uppermost in the grass pink and has a fishtail-like apical portion. Somewhat below this is a beard of yellow hairs that arises from a white background. The two sepals on either side of the lip are large, colorful, and petal-like. The remaining two petals and the third sepal compose the lower portion of the flower. The column, which comprises the stigma, style, and stamens, projects from the central part of the flower and curves upward. For certain reasons, Calopogon is now the correct generic name for this plant and refers to the colorful beard on the lip. The specific epithet tuberosus refers to the underground, tuberlike roots from which the shoots develop. Although the grass pink orchid is common in parts of the southeastern United States, it is generally uncommon in Louisiana, probably being restricted by special habitat requirements." -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.149	ORCHIDACEAE	Orchid Family	April 21, 1977	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

However, green dragon's one leaf is divided into five to fifteen segments, and jack-in-the-pulpit's, three to five segments. Green dragon's spadix is long and tapering and projects from a reduced spathe (the leaflike structure that surrounds and arches over the spadix of tiny, pollen- and seed-bearing flowers). Green dragon and jack-in-the-pulpit frequently grow together in mixed populations in moist, open woods with abundant leaf litter.

Libraries	2006-07-18	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Green hawthorn is a small, rounded tree that grows in bottomland forests and swamps. The attractive cinnamon-brown color of its sinewy trunk is revealed by thin, exfoliating sheets of outer, grayish bark. Generally, but especially in juvenile plants, the numerous twigs are armed with long, slender, sharp thorns. Its leaves vary considerably in size and shape, ranging from ovate to oblong with several coarse teeth and a variable number of lobes. Rounded clusters of delicate, white to pink flowers with many stamens, somewhat resembling plum blossoms, cover the tree in late spring. Despite their visual appeal, the flowers have an objectionable, unpleasant odor. Mature fruits are oblong, red to reddish orange, and rather dry and tasteless, unlike those of the highly prized mayhaw, Crataegus opaca."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 195	ROSACEAE	Rose Family	March 20, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

The arrowhead-shaped leaves of this plant are often visible above the surrounding marsh vegetation; its twining stems wrap around reeds, shrubs, and other objects for support. Throughout the summer and autumn months, vivid lavender-rose flowers with darker, reddish purple centers appear near the stem tips. The funnel-shaped corollas are about two inches in diameter and surround the five stamens inserted on the lower portion of the corolla tube.

This species is epiphytic, not parasitic, since its nutrients are obtained from the rainwater in which it bathes. The aerial stems typically bear two or three dark green leaves and may terminate with a cluster of as many as twenty yellowish green flowers. Except for the three-lobed lip, each perianth segment has a linear to oblanceolate shape. Numerous tiny seeds are produced in each ellipsoidal capsule. The green-fly orchid ranges from east Texas to North Carolina and southward into Florida.

Libraries	2006-09-23	1989	Bossier Parish	1976-1989	"Tradescantia or spiderworts are quite common, readily recognized, and often cultivated plants. Typically, they have slender, grasslike leaves with bases that sheathe the stem, and flowers in terminal clusters subtended by a leaflike bract. The flowers consist of three green sepals, three white, pink, or blue petals, six stamens supported on hairy filaments, and a single, three-parted pistil. On sunny days, the flowers are open early in the morning, but by midday, the petals actually seem to melt, leaving a droplet of bluish liquid. Hairy spiderwort is a relatively short, clumped perennial that usually has an abundance of nonglandular hairs on the stems and sepals. Its flowers are among the largest of our native species of spiderworts and range in color from deep purple to rose to white. Hairy spiderwort is known from all but some of the coastal parishes and those in the Mississippi River floodplain. Five other species of Tradescantia are reported for Louisiana, and the differences among them are rather technical."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.64	COMMELINACEAE	Spiderwort Family	April 22, 1983	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

When growing in a terrestrial habitat, it has creeping stems near the soil surface, and its narrow, simple, filiform leaves can be seen only if the soil is gently washed away from the stems. Its bladders, or traps, are minute and are borne along the leaf margins. Upright scapes to about one foot tall appear from summer to fall and normally support from one to as many as nine flowers. Its bright yellow corollas are about one inch wide with a helmet shaped lower lip and a down turned spur about one-half inch long. Horned bladderwort grows in the shallow water of ponds and ditches and in the wet soil of bogs and wet pinewoods of the eastern United States and southeastern Canada. Utricularia is a large, worldwide genus of mostly aquatic or wetland plants, but some South American species grow as epiphytes.

Libraries	2006-07-20	1989	Jefferson Parish	1976-1989	"Because of its gaudy, reddish purple heads with yellow-tipped rays, this species of Gaillardia has been appropriately called Indian blanket and firewheel. Color may vary considerably among the individual rays, from those that have broad, yellow tips to those that are completely reddish. This plant grows as a robust annual with alternate, smooth-margined or lobed, pubescent leaves. Indian blanket grows abundantly on coastal sand dunes and sandy cheniers, where it flowers almost year round. It grows in localities scattered throughout Louisiana, and its widespread distribution undoubtedly is due in part to the popularity of this species as a garden ornamental.

Libraries	2006-03-31	1989	Evangeline Parish	1976-1989	"Although Indian paint brush carpets vast areas of southeastern Texas with its bright red floral displays, it is rather uncommon in Louisiana. The few reports of this plant come from scattered areas in the western part of Louisiana and may represent accidental introductions from Texas. Indian paint brush is an annual that may grow in dense colonies. Individual plants are about one foot in height and have numerous narrow leaves.

Libraries	2006-09-16	1989	St. Helena Parish	1976-1989	"Vivid, red, trumpet-shaped flowers with yellow inner surfaces typify the Indian pink, which inhabits rich, moist, somewhat shady woods throughout the Southeast. Indian pink grows up to two feet tall and produces several pairs of opposite, simple leaves along its upright, unbranched stems. Its five-merous flowers are arranged in a terminal, one-sided spike with the oldest flowers at the base and progressively younger ones towards the apex. Indian pink, a favorite of native-plant gardeners, returns from its underground rhizome year after year, consistently producing its floral display. It was an early introduction to England and was discussed in Philip Miller's Gardeners Dictionary, published in several editions prior to 1797. Spigelia, a genus of about fifty species that grow in the Western Hemisphere, is represented in this country by about three other species. Some botanists treat Spigelia as belonging to its own family, but more commonly it is placed in the Loganiaceae. This largely tropical family is represented in Louisiana by yellow jessamine and a few other species. Buddleja, a popular ornamental, and Strychnos, the source of the highly toxic strychnine, are often considered members of the logania family."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 141	LOGANIACEAE	Logania Family	March 30, 1979	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-09-23	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Although a great diversity of habits occurs in Louisiana, visions of this state usually include vast swamps of picturesque cypress trees draped with Spanish moss. Appropriately, then, bald cypress has been designated the state tree. This tree is widely recognized by its knees and its deciduous branches bearing short, needlelike leaves and spherical seed cones. The smaller, pollen-bearing cones are supported in dense, drooping clusters and usually appear in January or February, long before the appearance of the bright green leaves. The function of the knees is as yet not completely clear to plant scientists, who suggest they might be pneumatophores (breathing organs), food storage depots, or a means of supporting such huge trees in the soft, wet muck of the swamp. There is also controversy about the taxonomic status of bald cypress because two forms can be found. Do we have one variable species, one species with two varieties, or two species? The most obvious difference between the two entities is the spread of the leaves; plants with leaves closely appressed to the stem are sometimes referred to as pond cypress, Taxodium ascendens. The national champion bald cypress, with a circumference of fifty-three feet eight inches and a height of eighty-three feet, is found on Cat Island, located in a relatively remote region of West Feliciana Parish."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 206	TAXODIACEAE	Bald Cypress Family	February 8, 1982; May 25, 1982 (leaves)	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

A large, saclike sepal with one end fashioned into a recurved spur is the most conspicuous part of the pendulous flower. The three petals are visible from the mouthlike, open end of the sepal, and five stamens are concealed within it. When touched, the mature fruits will open explosively to release their many seeds. Cupped within one's hand, unopened fruits will soon begin to jump about as they split into five segments, giving one the sensation of holding some crawling insect. The watery sap of the stems and leaves of this species is said to offer an effective treatment for poison ivy and warts.

Being a typical member of the legume family, lady lupine has flowers that consist of a keel, two wing petals, and a lavender banner with a dark purple spot. Lady lupine is a perennial herb with unifoliate leaves, and unusual feature for lupines, which generally have compound leaves with numerous leaflets. Its fruits are similar in structure to those of peas. An abundance of hairs gives the vegetative parts of the plants and the fruits a shaggy, silvery gray appearance. Lupinus villosus grows in sandy soils of the coastal plain from Florida to Louisiana, where it is known from a few locations in Washington and St. Tammany parishes. Some species of Lupinus are popular ornamental plants, and this species seems to have such potential as well, but little apparently is known about its culture characteristics. The generic name Lupinus comes from the Latin lupus, "wolf," because a crop of lupines was thought to destroy soil fertility. About two hundred species of lupines are known to occur mostly in temperate regions of the world."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 74	FABACEAE	Legume Family	April 15 (flowers), May 20 (unripe fruit), 1980	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Its thick, glossy leaves, which are shed each spring about the time flowers and new leaves appear, have pubescent lower leaf surfaces and smooth or slightly toothed to lobed margins. Live oak flowers are unisexual; pollen-producing ones are clustered in pendulous catkins, and the much fewer seed-producing ones are borne individually or in small clusters. Because of their adaptation for wind pollination, the flowers lack petals and are not showy. Elongated acorns are often produced in abundance in the fall. Live oak is long-lived and can grow to enormous size. The national champion tree, growing in Louisburg, Louisiana, is thirty-six feet seven inches in circumference.

lsu-sc-msw:96	Lizard's Tail	Saururus cernuus L.	Tucker, Shirley C.	Stones, Margaret	1976	Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, La.). Libraries	2006-09-16	1989	East Baton Rouge Parish	1976-1989	"Dense colonies of lizard's tail become conspicuous in the late springtime in swamps and wet ditches as the flowers on the long, tapering, drooping inflorescences come into bloom. Surprisingly, the showy, white, usually fragrant flowers lack sepals and petals and owe their color largely to the filaments of their numerous stamens. The simple, heart-shaped leaves are alternately arranged, and at each node a narrow scar encircles the stem. Only one other species is contained in the genus Saururus, S. chinensis of the Philippines and eastern Asia. In fact, the Saururaceae embraces a total of seven species. Anemopsis californica is native to southwestern North America, and Houttuynia cordata, an Asian plant sometimes used as an ornamental ground cover and for salads, has been recorded as a recent introduction to Louisiana."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.199	SAURURACEAE	Lizard's Tail Family	May 12, 1977	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-08-12	1989	Tangipahoa Parish	1976-1989	"Pinus palustris is the principal tree on the upland soils and the seasonally wet, sandy flatlands of the southeastern coastal plain. The longleaf pine plant community, believed to have occupied seventy million acres stretching from southeastern Texas to Virginia prior to European settlement, has been greatly reduced in size and otherwise modified. Adaptation to fire has been one of the major reasons for the success of longleaf pine. One special modification making it so adapted is its "grass stage," which is characterized by initial slow growth and a single, unbranched stem supporting a cluster of long needles. The needles and the clusters of silvery scales surrounding the terminal bud protect it from heat as fires race through the grassy understory. Among our native pines, this species is recognized as having the longest leaves and the largest cones. Longleaf pine is an important timber species, and its resin is a valuable source of turpentine and other naval stores. This species also provides a home for many animals, including the rare red-cockaded woodpecker, which lives in hollows of old trees."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 168	PINACEAE	Pine Family	March 12, 1980	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

lsu-sc-msw:99	Louisiana Bear Grass	Yucca louisianensis Trel.	Pope, Tom	Stones, Margaret	1976	Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, La.). Libraries	2006-10-07	1989	Vernon Parish	1976-1989	"Louisiana bear grass, a member of the lily family, occurs in dry, sandy soils in central and northwestern Louisiana and adjacent parts of Arkansas and Texas. The stout stems of this plant may grow to eighteen inches tall and support a rounded cluster of leaves whose white-bordered margins are somewhat shredded into filaments. The flowers are about one inch long and are composed of six similar, petal-like members, six stamens, and a three-parted pistil. Various species of Yucca have in the past been a valuable resource to Native Americans and early settlers. The flower buds, flowers, young inflorescences, and fruits of some species are edible. Their leaves have served as a source of fiber and their roots as a source of soaplike substances. Yucca contains about thirty species, found mostly in the arid regions of North America, and some are grown as ornamentals. Variation among and between species is not well studied, making the application of the scientific names somewhat difficult. The yuccas are similar to agaves, and the two are sometimes placed together in the same plant family. Yuccas differ, however, in having a superior ovary."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 120	LILIACEAE	Lily Family	April 5, 1981	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.

Libraries	2006-03-31	1989	St. Tammany Parish	1976-1989	"Bartonia generally goes undetected by most observers of nature because of its small stature and late-winter flowering period. The plant seldom grows more than ten inches tall and bears tiny, scalelike leaves on its wiry, purple stems. The flowers, which may open in Louisiana as early as January, provided the weather has been warm enough, each consist of four sepals, four white petals, and four stamens. At maturity, numerous minute seeds form within tiny capsules. Bartonia inhabits bogs and wet pine savannas and can generally be found where pitcher plants grow." -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p. 93	GENTIANACEAE	Gentian Family	March 10, 1979	still image	watercolor drawing	jp2	Approx. 57 x 38 cm	en	Louisiana State University Libraries, Special Collections ( http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special )	http://lsu.louisianadigitallibrary.org/lsu-msw%3Acollection	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	LUU	Louisiana State University: LSU Libraries	http://lib.lsu.edu	Hill Memorial Library: Special Collections	E-mail lsudiglib@lsu.edu with questions or comments.
