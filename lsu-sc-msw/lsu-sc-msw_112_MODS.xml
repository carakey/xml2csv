   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"The narrow-leaved white violet (left) is one of the two white-flowered species that commonly grows in Louisiana.  It is a so-called stemless type, which means it has short, underground stems.  Its leaves form a rosette, and the first ones to appear in the spring are much shorter and wider than the narrowly lanceolate ones that appear later.  The plant's solitary, nodding buds are supported on long stalks.  Upon opening, the flowers, like those of other violets, are bilaterally symmetrical with five sepals and petals.  The intricate veins on the lower half of the spurred petal are purple, while the upper half of this petal and the other four petals are white, sometimes with faintly colored veins.  Narrow-leaved white violet is distributed throughout eastern North America.  The species usually grows in moist, sunny locations in wet pine savannas and along ditches and woodland borders.  Although the violet family in North America essentially consists of the genus Viola, it contains several species of tropical shrubs belonging to several different genera."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 208</abstract>
