   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Wild ginger grows in the rich, moist soil of shady hardwood forests of southeastern Louisiana.  Long petioles, which arise from a short underground stem, support mottled, fleshy, evergreen, triangular leaf blades.  Typically, one or two such leaves are formed each season, but with good growing conditions, several leaves develop.  The unusual, fleshy, reddish brown flowers are found in the leaf litter and are generally seen only by the informed, alert naturalist.  Lacking petals, the flowers consist of a fleshy calyx fused into a jug-shaped structure that contains the stamens and pistils.  Wild ginger has a pleasant, gingerlike aroma and, reportedly, has been used as a seasoning.  Under certain garden conditions, this plant may be a useful and interesting groundcover."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 6</abstract>
