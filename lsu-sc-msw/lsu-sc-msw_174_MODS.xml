   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Southern crabapple, a member of the rose family, is indigenous to the coastal and interior regions of Virginia and Florida westward to Texas and Missouri.  This small tree is widely distributed on lighter, well-drained soils of Louisiana.  Prized for its floral displays, this small tree produces clusters of pink buds in the early spring that soon give way to delicate, fragrant, rose-pink flowers adorning its numerous, slender, somewhat-spiny branchlets.  The simple, alternately arranged leaves with toothed to slightly lobed margins, mature soon after flowering.  In autumn, the trees bear greenish yellow apples about two inches in diameter that are suitable for apple preserves.  Although not frequently seen in cultivation, southern crabapple would be attractive if planted in mass or individually.  Cedarapple rust, a potential problem in growing this species, may cause the leaves to become unsightly.  Orchard crabapples, those grown for fruit, most likely belong to the species Malus pumila, a plant native to northern China and Siberia.  The ornamental, or flowering, crabapples include a number of different species and varieties mostly of oriental origin."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 196</abstract>
