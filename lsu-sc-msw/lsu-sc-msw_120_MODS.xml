   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Paw paw is a large shrub to small tree that often grows in clumps in rich woods and along stream banks in the eastern United States. Its flower and leaf buds, young twigs, and leaves are covered with rusty hairs. The large leaves are obovate and, when crushed, have an odor like that of bell peppers. The unusual flowers are characterized by six greenish petals that become mauve at maturity. The berrylike fruit is flavorful. Paw paws, if grown in the landscape, will flower and fruit more heavily in a sunny location. Several tropical members of this plant family, such as the annona, bear edible fruit of considerable importance."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.1</abstract>
