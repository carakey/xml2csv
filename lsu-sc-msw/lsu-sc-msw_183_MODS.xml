   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Spreading aster is an erect perennial that grows to nearly three feet tall. It is quite common in open, dry fields and at the edges of woodlands in Louisiana and the eastern United States. The plant is readily recognizable by its nearly sessile leaves that have a basal pair of earlobe-like structures and by its branches, especially in the inflorescence, which diverge at nearly a ninety-degree angle from the main stem. The epithet refers to this branching pattern. The heads, which terminate the inflorescence, measure an inch or more across when in flower. They have a yellow disk and numerous bluish or sometimes white rays. Attached to the ovary where it joins the corolla is a series of bristles, called the pappus, which assist in the dissemination of the fruit by the wind."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.7</abstract>
