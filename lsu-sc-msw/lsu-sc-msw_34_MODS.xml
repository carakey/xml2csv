   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Found in dry, sunny sites mostly east of the Rockies, the butterfly weed is well known to wildflower enthusiasts. Dense clusters of various shades of brilliant orange flowers bloom from the ends of numerous branches of this rather low-growing, weak-stemmed plant. A cloak of coarse hairs gives the leafy stems a rough texture. Unlike most milkweeds, this species does not produce a milky latex. Perhaps the common name has been given to this plant because butterflies are attracted to the copious nectar of the flowers or because from some distance the flowers give the appearance of clouds of orange butterflies hovering near the ground. Butterfly weed is a popular garden ornamental. Its large-branched taproot, however, makes transplanting a futile exercise. Greater success in propagation comes from germinating wild collected seed or from root cuttings."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.6</abstract>
