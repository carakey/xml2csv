   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Bellwort is a delicate perennial that grows on rich, wooded hillsides.  Its shoots emerge from a slender rhizome in the early spring.  Their yellow-green, elliptic leaves are at first folded and closely clustered as the stem emerges, but they become more widely separated after they fully elongate.  The pendant flowers, which appear with the new leaves, are a pale yellow.  Their corollas are each composed of six similar segments and surround the six stamens and the three-parted ovary.  Uvularia seems to be an unusual name for a plant.  Apparently, the manner in which the pretty, pendant flowers hang from the inflorescence reminded Linnaeus, who named the plant, of the uvula of the palate.  This eastern North American genus belongs in the lily family and contains five species.  Besides U. sessilifolia, one other species, U. perfoliata, grows in Louisiana.  The former is known only from some of the northern parishes, and the latter is restricted to the extreme southeastern part of the state."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 140</abstract>
