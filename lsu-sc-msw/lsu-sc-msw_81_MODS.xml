   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Tradescantia or spiderworts are quite common, readily recognized, and often cultivated plants.  Typically, they have slender, grasslike leaves with bases that sheathe the stem, and flowers in terminal clusters subtended by a leaflike bract.  The flowers consist of three green sepals, three white, pink, or blue petals, six stamens supported on hairy filaments, and a single, three-parted pistil.  On sunny days, the flowers are open early in the morning, but by midday, the petals actually seem to melt, leaving a droplet of bluish liquid.  Hairy spiderwort is a relatively short, clumped perennial that usually has an abundance of nonglandular hairs on the stems and sepals.  Its flowers are among the largest of our native species of spiderworts and range in color from deep purple to rose to white.  Hairy spiderwort is known from all but some of the coastal parishes and those in the Mississippi River floodplain.  Five other species of Tradescantia are reported for Louisiana, and the differences among them are rather technical."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.64</abstract>
