   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Mountain laurel is noted for its handsome foliage and flowers.  Its simple, shiny leaves are evergreen and leathery.  Large, rounded clusters of flowers appear at the ends of the many branches in late spring.  Each flower is about an inch in diameter and displays exquisite symmetrical beauty.  The sepals and petals number five each, and the latter form a saucer-shaped corolla that ranges in color from nearly white to dark pink.  The ten stamens of each flower are unusual because their anthers are held in small pouches in the corolla.  This bizarre structure represents a mechanism to aid cross-pollination.  An insect landing on a flower causes the anthers to release and spring forward, dusting it with pollen that may then be transferred to other flowers on other plants.  Mountain laurel grows naturally from Louisiana to Florida and northward to Ohio and New York.  In Louisiana, this species is quite rare, growing only on a few sites in Washington Parish.  In the southern parts of its range, mountain laurel may attain thirty feet in height, but northward the shrubs are much smaller.  Kalmia, a genus of about six species, is restricted to North America.  Other widely known plants of the heath family include azaleas, rhododendrons, blueberries, and cranberries."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 68</abstract>
