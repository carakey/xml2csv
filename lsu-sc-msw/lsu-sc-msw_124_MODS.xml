   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Pickerel weed is common along ditches and streams and in the shallow water of ponds and lakes throughout much of eastern North America.  Rooting in the mud, this aquatic plant produces upright stems as tall as three feet.  Arising from near the plant's base are several erect, long-petiolate leaves with cordate to lanceolate blades.  Just below the base of the inflorescence is a heart-shaped, leaflike bract.  Elongated spikes of bilaterally symmetrical flowers appear in late spring, and flowering may continue throughout the summer.  The sepals and petals are showy and bluish violet, and the upper segment bears a yellow mark.  Six stamens of two lengths are attached within the perianth, and a single-seeded fruit matures from the ovary.  A small solitary bee, Dufourea, appears to depend completely on a pickerel weed for its livelihood.  Pickerel weed is attractive and worthy of planting in a garden pond, especially one in a natural setting.  It is related to water hyacinth, the introduced, attractive, but troublesome weed of waterways in the southern United States."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 192</abstract>
