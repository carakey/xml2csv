   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Magnificent flowers as large as six inches in diameter with white or sometimes pink corollas and rose-colored centers highlight the vegetation of marshy areas of the southeastern United States.  In general aspect, the flowers of scarlet rose-mallow resemble those of cotton, also a member of the mallow family.  A calyx of five green sepals arises below the showy petals.  Within the corolla, and typical of all Malvaceae, is the column that is formed by fusion of the numerous stamen filaments.  This plant grows to about eight feet tall and has alternate, glabrous, typically three-lobed leaves.  Scarlet rose-mallow is common in Louisiana and bears one of the largest blossoms of our herbaceous wildflowers.  A few other native species of Hibiscus are represented in Louisiana, and several exotic ones are used as houseplants or garden ornamentals."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 143</abstract>
