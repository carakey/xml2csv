   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Bigleaf magnolia, an uncommon tree of the moist, rich woods of certain stream drainage systems in central and southeastern Louisiana, is spectacular in having leaves as long as three feet supported in umbrella-like clusters at the branch tips. Its deciduous leaves are distinctive not only in size but also by their auriculately lobed bases and silvery undersides. Creamy white flowers one foot long open in late spring and would hold the undisputed title of our largest native flower, if there were such a designation. Typical conelike magnolia fruits develop from the numerous pistils of the flower and mature in the fall. Although they may attain heights of about seventy feet and trunk diameters of approximately two fee, most individuals typically remain much smaller trees. Bigleaf magnolia grows in the understory on rich but well-drained soils of riparian and slope forests of the southeaster United States. This species is not widely adaptable in cultivation, preferring conditions similar to those found in nature." -- Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 128</abstract>
