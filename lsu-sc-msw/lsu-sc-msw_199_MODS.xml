   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Texas coneflower is restricted primarily to seasonally wet pine savannas of western Louisiana and eastern Texas.  Relatively large, upright, ovate, basal leaves with long petioles grow from an underground rhizome, which by midsummer produces a robust, flowering shoot.  Clasping the upright stem at rather evenly spaced intervals are several, progressively smaller, broadly ovate leaves.  Each of its few branch tips supports a large, cone-shaped head with about a dozen showy, reflexed, bright yellow rays.  The disk, composed of approximately three hundred individual flowers, is about two inches tall and green in the bud stage but becomes purplish brown as its flowers progressively open.  Until recently, the populations in Louisiana and Texas were considered to be a variety of Rudbeckia nitida, whose geographic range extends from southern Alabama and Georgia into northern Florida.  Research has shown R. texana to be specifically distinct.  Rudbeckia is a genus of approximately twenty species, including the widespread and often cultivated R. hirta."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 45</abstract>
