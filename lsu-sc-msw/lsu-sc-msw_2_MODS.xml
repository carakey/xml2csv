   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Two species  from the same family appear on this watercolor drawing.  In late spring and summer, spikes of small, bluish flowers of the bluehearts commonly appear among the diverse flora of the wet pine savannas of the coastal plain of Louisiana and the Southeast.  As many as six flowers may appear on each spike; each flower is composed of five, somewhat-unequal petals.  Along the stems, which may attain a height of two feet, are several pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves.  The number of veins in the leaves is an important characteristic in distinguishing between the two species of bluehearts, which may grow in mixed colonies.  American bluehearts (right) have single-veined lower leaves, and the Florida bluehearts (left) have three-veined lower leaves.  The genus Buchnera contains about one hundred species, which mostly inhabit the Old World tropics and subtropics." -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p. 202.</abstract>
