   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Sampson's snakeroot is widely distributed in the dry, sandy soils of Louisiana, and it presents an attractive floral display, especially when grown in mass.  The numerous, branching stems arising from the tuberous roots of this perennial bear several alternately inserted trifoliolate leaves.  Arranged in dense, terminal racemes are its lilac flowers, resembling those of the pea plant.  Its legumes, the fruit of Sampson's snakeroot, are tiny pods about one-half inch long.  Sometime in the past, a concoction from the roots of this plant apparently was prescribed for the treatment of snakebite.  Evidently, the results were not greatly successful.  Sampson's snakeroot is colorful while in flower but has a rather short blooming season.  Nevertheless, it could provide an attractive, early spring flora display in a naturalistic setting, and perhaps it has potential for use in roadside plantings.  Psoralea, a genus of more than one hundred species mainly from tropical and subtropical regions, is sometimes subdivided into several smaller genera.  Its name means "scabby" and refers to the glandular dots typically found on its lower leaf surfaces."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 92</abstract>
