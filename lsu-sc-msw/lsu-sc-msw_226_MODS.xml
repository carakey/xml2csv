   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Although small in stature and deceptively attractive, the insectivorous yellow butterwort must seem like a menacing monster to a variety of insects.  Glandular hairs secrete a viscous fluid that entraps and subsequently digests small creatures that alight on the plant's leaves.  The leaf margins roll upward-a mechanism that seems to aid this plant's eating habits.  Insectivory provides yellow butterwort with nutrients and is a means of survival in its native habitat, the nutrient-poor, wet pine savannas and bogs of the coastal plain from extreme southeastern Louisiana eastward to North Carolina and Florida.  Flowers of this species, which are held about six inches above its rosette are large and showy and are characterized by a large, nectar-secreting spur petal.  If provided with appropriate light and moisture conditions, yellow butterwort can be propagated from seeds and planted in the garden."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 103</abstract>
