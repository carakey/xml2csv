   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Although fairy wand occurs widely throughout the eastern United States, it is quite rare in Louisiana, where only a few plants have been found on a few rich, wooded hillsides.  This member of the lily family develops a basal rosette of leaves and, at flowering, produces elongated flowering stalks with reduced leaves.  Each of the numerous flowers is composed of six petal-like perianth parts.  Pollen- and seed-producing flowers grow on separate plants.  Pollen plants appear every year, while seed-producing ones may flower every two or three years.  The name devil's bit seems inappropriate for this elegant woodland wildflower.  Apparently, the name was familiar to English immigrants, who applied it to a vaguely similar plant in their new land." --Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 106</abstract>
