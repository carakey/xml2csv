   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"The beauty berry, also called French mulberry, is one of the most common and widely recognized shrubs of the moist to dry upland forest borders and lightly shaded pine woods.  Dense clusters of lavender-pink flowers adorn the upper leaf axils and give way to vivid, magenta, berrylike fruits in autumn.  The simple, deciduous leaves of beauty berry are alternate to whorled and have somewhat-toothed margins.  This many-branched, medium-sized shrub is sometimes grown for ornamental purposes because of its attractive, unusual fruits and its adaptability to various soil conditions.  Occasionally, white-fruited forms of this plant appear in the wild, and some of these have been selected for horticultural use.  Although this genus is represented in our area by a single species, well over a hundred species are known to exist in tropical and subtropical regions."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.206</abstract>
