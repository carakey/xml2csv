   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Cucumber magnolia, one of the five Magnolia species native to Louisiana, is fairly common on rich, wooded hillsides, throughout much of the eastern United States.  It may become a large tree, achieving a height of about seventy-five feet and a trunk diameter of more than three feet.  Like other magnolias, its leaves are simple and alternate, but deciduous-unlike those of southern magnolia, which are evergreen.  Flowers of the cucumber magnolia appear in early spring just as the new leaves begin to unfold.  Their typically nine, pale, greenish yellow perianth parts are slender and arch gracefully upward.  Many short-lived, spirally attached stamens lie between the perianth and the numerous pistils.  Each flower forms a conelike aggregate fruit that is somewhat cucumber-shaped.  Cucumber magnolia is a desirable, but seldom used, ornamental shade tree that has a form somewhat like that of the tulip tree."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 142</abstract>
