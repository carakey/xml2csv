   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Crested coral-root is extraordinary, since it is one of the few orchids that does not make its own food.  This plant is a saprophyte, i.e., its organic nutrients are derived not from photosynthesis but from the rich, humic soils in which it grows.  Having adopted this mode of nutrition, crested coral-root exhibits a syndrome of unusual adaptations.  It has no need for large leaves; instead, the plant has reduced, scalelike bracts along its yellowish brown to purple stem.  Living in shady, moist habitats has apparently reduced the plant's need for large amounts of water and, consequently, has resulted in its loss of roots.  It develops fleshy, succulent rhizomes underground.  Atop its upright stems, which may be as tall as three feet, spikes of from five to twenty-five gaudily decorated flowers typically appear midsummer or later.  The color of its sepals and petals ranges from yellow to yellow-brown, and they are purple striped.  Five fleshy crests characterize the enlarged lip of this species."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 151</abstract>
