   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Rhexia is the only genus of the large, mostly tropical meadow beauty family to grow in the United States, where it is represented by approximately a dozen species.  These are readily recognizable by their four angled stems and opposite, simple leaves with three main veins running from the leaf base to its tip.  The flowers of all species are exquisite.  Smooth meadow beauty (center), with its glabrous, upright stems that branch only in the inflorescence and its vividly colored flowers, is one of the showiest.  Its four rose-lavender petals are about one inch in length, and its eight bright yellow anthers site on filaments having an elbowlike bend.  The urn-shaped fruits persist on the plant long after its seeds have been shed.  Smooth meadow beauty flowers throughout the summer and provides one of the main sources of color in its native habitat, the wet pine savannas of extreme southeastern and central Louisiana.  Although this species has been little used as a garden plant, it has considerable potential in this regard.  Most likely it could be propagated from seed and would require moist, but well-drained, acid soil in a sunny location.  Rhexia mariana (left) is a common, highly variable species that grows in similar habitats.  This species differs from the smooth meadow beauty in having pubescent stems and diverse shades of pink to rose petals."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 132</abstract>
