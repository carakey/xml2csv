   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Jewel weed, an inhabitant of the shady, moist woodlands of Louisiana and the eastern United States, is readily identifiable by its unusual, colorful flowers.  A large, saclike sepal with one end fashioned into a recurved spur is the most conspicuous part of the pendulous flower.  The three petals are visible from the mouthlike, open end of the sepal, and five stamens are concealed within it.  When touched, the mature fruits will open explosively to release their many seeds.  Cupped within one's hand, unopened fruits will soon begin to jump about as they split into five segments, giving one the sensation of holding some crawling insect.  The watery sap of the stems and leaves of this species is said to offer an effective treatment for poison ivy and warts.  The epithet capensis was bestowed on this species because it was initially, but mistakenly, thought to be from the Cape of Good Hope, Africa."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 46</abstract>
