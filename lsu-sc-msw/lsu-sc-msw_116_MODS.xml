   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Late springtime is when obedient plant is seen in great abundance in wet roadside ditches and moist swales, primarily in extreme southeastern Louisiana.  Its terminal racemes of large, pale lavender flowers are supported by stiff, upright stems that may grow to about three feet in height.  Within their two-lipped corollas, and adding to their beauty, are intricate patterns of darker purple dots and lines that presumably serve as nectar guides for pollinating insects. Not only are the flowers attractive, they are also obedient, because when moved from side to side, they will remain where they have been positioned.  Physostegia angustifolia has been recorded in other parts of Louisiana and from Texas to Alabama northward to Missouri.  The genus, readily placed in the mint family because of its square stems, opposite leaves, and certain floral features, embraces approximately a dozen species.  Although Physostegia is widely distributed in North America, the greatest concentration of its different species can be found in western Louisiana and eastern Texas.  At the time this drawing was executed and prior to it, our plants were thought to be P. virginiana, but more recent investigations have revealed this to be a more northern species.  P. virginiana is the correct name for the common species in Louisiana."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 90</abstract>
