   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Yellow lotus, an emergent aquatic plant of fresh and brackish water, grows in ponds, bayous, and quiet streams throughout the eastern United States.  This species is characterized by horizontal, underwater stems and large, disk-shaped leaf blades that rise above the water on long, stout stalks.  Its solitary, showy, yellow flowers are about six to ten inches in diameter and are composed of numerous perianth parts and spirally inserted stamens.  Featured within the flower's center is an enlarged receptacle with several pistils partially embedded in it.  At maturity, the receptacle, with its nutlike fruits, becomes brown and woody and is often used in dried-flower arrangements.  Its underwater stems are edible, and so are its seeds, which may be eaten--raw or boiled--at an immature or mature stage.  Yellow lotus may be cultivated for its attractive flowers and fruits.  Nelumbo nucifera, the ornamentally grown sacred lotus of the Old World, is characterized by pink flowers and is occasionally seen in the wild."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 134</abstract>
