   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"The sweetly fragrant, white flowers of the swamp lily dot the coastal marshes in summer and fall.  A profusely rooted bulb several inches below the surface of the soil anchors this plant to its marshy habitat.  Arising from the bulb are many strap-shaped, dark green leaves and a fleshy stalk tipped with four to six flowers.  Each lilylike flower of six arching perianth parts may be as much as six inches in diameter.  Reddish purple stamens as numerous as the perianth parts offer a striking contrast to the white petals and sepals.  As the maturing fruit gains weight, the stalk supporting it bends to the ground, and the three seeds within begin to germinate.  As many as one hundred species of Crinum have been reported from warm, wet regions throughout the world."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 14</abstract>
