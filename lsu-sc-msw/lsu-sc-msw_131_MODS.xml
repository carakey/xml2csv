   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Pink evening primrose, commonly seen along roadsides and in vacant lots, is one of our most abundant and showy wildflowers.  Great colonies of this plant may color vast areas of the landscape pink or sometimes white in the early spring.  These vivid floral displays are often encouraged by the sowing of seeds and by allowing the plants to mature until they reseed themselves.  The flowers of this herbaceous plant have four sepals and four petals.  Copious amounts of yellow pollen grains strung together by viscid threads are produced by the eight stamens near the center of each flower.  Presumably, this is the reason these plants are sometimes called buttercups.  Several other kinds of showy evening primroses are indigenous to Louisiana, but they are far less common than Oenothera speciosa.  Other showy flowered members of the evening primrose family include the water primroses and the fuchsias, which are grown in cooler climates for their brightly colored flowers."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 156</abstract>
