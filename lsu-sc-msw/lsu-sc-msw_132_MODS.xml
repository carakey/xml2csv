   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Claret flowers of the poppy mallow, or winecup, present colorful wildflower displays on the drier hills and along roadsides mostly in central and western Louisiana.  Poppy mallow, despite its superficial resemblance to poppies, is a member of the mallow family, which also contains such familiar plants as cotton, okra, and hibiscus.  The cup-shaped flowers of poppy mallow are formed by five uniform petals an inch or more in length.  Numerous pale yellow stamens, fused by their filaments, form a columnar structure in the central part of the flower of this species and other members of this plant family.  The stems of this herbaceous perennial attaining a length of about two feet, sprawl along the ground and support alternate leaves that are divided into three to five narrow segments.  The genus grows mostly in the Great Plains and contains about ten species."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.143
