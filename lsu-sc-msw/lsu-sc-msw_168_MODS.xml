   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Perhaps originally native to the southeastern United States as far west as extreme southeastern Louisiana, the slash pine has had its range greatly expanded because of its importance as a timber species and a landscape plant.  It is one of only seven species of gymnosperms and one of five kinds of pine that grow naturally in Louisiana.  Like most other pines, it has a single upright trunk and progressively smaller branches upward, giving the tree a conical shape.  Ephemeral, purple, pollen cones about two inches long are produced in abundance in the early spring.  Much less conspicuous are the seed cones which are only about one-quarter of an inch long at the time of pollination but grow to six inches at maturity.  This species is readily identified by its needles, which grow in bundles of twos and threes, and by its stalked, reddish brown seed cone.  The national champion slash pine, reported from Florida, is 150 feet tall and has a trunk circumference of 11 feet 3 inches."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 188</abstract>
