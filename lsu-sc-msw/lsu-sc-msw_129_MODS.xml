   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Most grasses have little to offer in terms of attractive flowers or foliage; the piney woods dropseed is one of the few exceptions.  A tufted perennial, this species grows in sandy soil in forest openings and along woodland borders.  Its many stems may grow to three feet in height, though they are usually shorter, and its numerous, slender leaves are mostly confined to near the plant's base.  A variety of colors is seen within the tall, narrowly pyramidal inflorescences when the plants are in flower.  Grass flowers are unusual; they lack a perianth but are enclosed by a pair of bracts and are usually arranged into multi-flowered structures called spikelets.  When first in flower, the intricately arranged bracts are reddish purple, and the three anthers of each flower are bright orange.  The fruit of this species is a tiny grain.  Sporobolus, a large genus, comprises about 150 species, which grow in the warmer parts of the world.  Grasses have been of enormous importance to humankind in providing food, forage for animals, and materials for shelter.  In terms of species diversity, Poaceae is the second largest plant family in Louisiana, with more than three hundred species."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 189</abstract>
