   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"This showy annual plant grows in wet meadows and bogs.  Its leaves, typically in whorls of four, form a crosslike configuration at each node, a formation that probably accounts for its specific epithet.  Dense, oblong to cylindrical racemes, nearly an inch tall and broad, terminate the stem's apex.  Somewhat resembling legume blossoms, each of drum head's flowers show a number of unusual modifications typical for the milkwort family.  Its sepals are of two types: three very small outer ones, and two, longer, inner, petal-like ones often referred to as the wings.  In Polygala cruciata, the three petals are somewhat smaller than the wings and are covered by them.  Within the perianth are eight stamens fused by their filaments forming a tube that is split on one side.  The single pistil is characterized by a bent style and a two-lobed stigma.  Polygala in Louisiana is a diverse group represented by nearly twenty species."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 191</abstract>
