   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"The white violet (right) is exceedingly common in wet habitats such as bogs, ditch banks, and woodland streams throughout most of Louisiana.  It is a stemless, white-flowered species that is readily distinguished from Viola lanceolata by its broader, shorter leaves and often heart-shaped leaf bases.  Its spurred lower petal and its two lateral petals have violet to somewhat brownish veins.  The lateral petals may bear several crowded hairs at their bases, forming a so-called beard.  Its fruit, like that of other violets, is a three-parted capsule that opens rather explosively in order to disseminate its seeds more widely.  Violets are relatively easy to grow as ornamentals if planted in a rich, moist, somewhat-shady habitat."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 208</abstract>
