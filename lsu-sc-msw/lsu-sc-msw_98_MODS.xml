   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Pinus palustris is the principal tree on the upland soils and the seasonally wet, sandy flatlands of the southeastern coastal plain.  The longleaf pine plant community, believed to have occupied seventy million acres stretching from southeastern Texas to Virginia prior to European settlement, has been greatly reduced in size and otherwise modified.  Adaptation to fire has been one of the major reasons for the success of longleaf pine.  One special modification making it so adapted is its "grass stage," which is characterized by initial slow growth and a single, unbranched stem supporting a cluster of long needles.  The needles and the clusters of silvery scales surrounding the terminal bud protect it from heat as fires race through the grassy understory.  Among our native pines, this species is recognized as having the longest leaves and the largest cones.  Longleaf pine is an important timber species, and its resin is a valuable source of turpentine and other naval stores.  This species also provides a home for many animals, including the rare red-cockaded woodpecker, which lives in hollows of old trees."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 168</abstract>
