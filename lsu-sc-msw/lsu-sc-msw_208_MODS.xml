   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Violet wood sorrel is a delicate little plant that has been widely reported from dry, open woods throughout much of Louisiana.  The trifoliolate leaves of this stemless plant arise from a scaly, underground bulb.  Each of the leaflets is somewhat heart-shaped and usually violet to crimson beneath and green or variegated with purplish markings above.  Like those of many Oxalis species, the leaflets exhibit sleep movements by folding down at night.  Several five-merous, geraniumlike flowers are produced on each flowering stalk.  Each of the petals, which may range in color from nearly white to violet, is tipped with an orange gland.  Violet wood sorrel normally produces leaves and flowers in the spring, but in the late summer and fall it may flower without leaves.  Although toxic in larger amounts, a substance called oxalic acid imparts a rather pleasant, sour taste to the foliage, which may be sparingly used to flavor salads.  Oxalis is a genus of several hundred species.  Some are useful as garden or indoor ornamentals, while others, such as yellow wood sorrel, are common, weedy species."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 155</abstract>
