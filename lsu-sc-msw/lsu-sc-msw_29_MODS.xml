   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Growing in many-stemmed clumps in meadows and pastures and along roadsides, blue-eyed grass creates colorful springtime floral vistas.  The ephemeral flowers, usually lasting a day or part of a day, are arranged in umbrella-like clusters and arise from between a pair of bracts called spathes.  The perianth has a yellow center, or eye, and is composed of six petal-like, blue-violet members, each with a small point.  Although several species of Sisyrinchium are indigenous to Louisiana, knowledge of their taxonomy is poor, making the application of correct names difficult.  Some of the species are rather weedy, small annuals with white, yellow, or dingy violet flowers.  Indeed, the name blue-eyed grass is misleading not only because the flower color varies but also because this species is not a grass but a member of the iris family.  This plant's relation to the irises is supported by details of its floral structure: the six perianth members, three stamens, and inferior ovary."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 100</abstract>
