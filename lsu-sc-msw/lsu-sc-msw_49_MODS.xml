   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"This high-climbing, woody vine grows in various habitats, including fence rows and woodland borders.  It belongs to a family of mostly tropical trees that typically produce variously colored, trumpet-shaped flowers.  Crossvine corollas are reddish orange externally and yellow within.  The unusual compound leaves, which are oppositely arranged, consist of a pair of leaflets and branched tendrils.  Other notable features of the crossvine and other members of this family are the long pods and the winged seeds.  This plant's name refers to the crosslike configuration formed by various tissues within the stem."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.36</abstract>
