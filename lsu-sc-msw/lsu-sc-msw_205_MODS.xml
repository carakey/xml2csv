   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Lonicera sempervirens is commonly called trumpet honeysuckle or coral honeysuckle.  It is a woody, twining or clambering vine widely distributed throughout the eastern United States.  This species is often cultivated for its attractive tubular flowers, which are red on the outside and yellowish within.  Because of their color, shape, and nectar production, these flowers are attractive to hummingbirds.  Spherical fruits of various shades of yellow, orange, and red are produced in late summer and fall.  The smooth, undivided leaves of coral honeysuckle occur in pairs.  The uppermost pair is fused and completely surrounds the stem.  The botanical name Lonicera commemorates the sixteenth-century German physician and naturalist Adam Lonicer.  Its specific epithet means "evergreen"; plants grown in mild climate retain their leaves during the winter.  Lonicera includes several popular ornamental shrubs and vines, as well as the weedy Japanese honeysuckle that grows abundantly throughout the southeast."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 50</abstract>
