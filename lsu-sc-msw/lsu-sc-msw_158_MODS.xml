   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Running violet forms mats on the forest floor because its stems creep along the ground and root at the nodes, a feature unique among species of Viola in Louisiana.  Its small, orbicular to kidney-shaped leaves have purple undersides, and at least when young, they are mottled above with dark green, purple, and sometimes silvery gray markings.  Like most of our violets, V. walteri has blue-violet flowers.  The spurred petal and the two lateral petals have darker veins and a basal, white to pale-colored blotch.  Running violet has been reported growing in virtually all parishes except the coastal ones.  Toward the end of its flowering period, specialized cleistogamous flowers are formed.  These flowers develop on short stalks, never open, and produce seeds as a result of self-pollination.  This flower type occurs in other kinds of violets and other plant species, possibly as the result of stressful growing conditions.  The epithet commemorates Thomas Walter, author of Flora Caroliniana, published in 1788."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.186</abstract>
