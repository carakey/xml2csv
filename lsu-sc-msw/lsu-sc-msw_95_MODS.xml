   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Live oak is native to the coastal regions from eastern Texas to Virginia, but because it is highly prized for its spreading form and attractive foliage, it has been extensively planted on more inland sites.  Its thick, glossy leaves, which are shed each spring about the time flowers and new leaves appear, have pubescent lower leaf surfaces and smooth or slightly toothed to lobed margins.  Live oak flowers are unisexual; pollen-producing ones are clustered in pendulous catkins, and the much fewer seed-producing ones are borne individually or in small clusters.  Because of their adaptation for wind pollination, the flowers lack petals and are not showy.  Elongated acorns are often produced in abundance in the fall.  Live oak is long-lived and can grow to enormous size.  The national champion tree, growing in Louisburg, Louisiana, is thirty-six feet seven inches in circumference.  Live oak often provides suitable habitat for various epiphytes such as Spanish moss and resurrection fern."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 78</abstract>
