   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"This delicate, little, terrestrial orchid is found in the rich, moist, oak woodlands of the Tunica Hills near St. Francisville, Louisiana.  The bases of the several, evenly spaced, narrow leaves surround and clasp the stem and are reminiscent of dayflower leaves.  A conical cluster of small, yellowish to white flowers terminate the leafy stems.  Noteworthy features of the flower include the prominent spur formed at the base of the three-lobed lip, and the dorsal sepal and two other petals that arch over the lip.  The summer woodland orchid is so named because of its specific epithet querceticola, which means "growing in oak woods," and because it is one of the few orchids of this region to flower in late summer.  Some authorities refer this species to the genus Erythrodes."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 153</abstract>
