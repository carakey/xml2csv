   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"This well-known, large, deciduous-leaved shrub inhabits moist, sandy soils along many of the streams in Louisiana and the southeastern United States.  Mature individuals may be nearly twenty feet tall.  Their alternate leaves range from one to four inches long and are often crowded near the branch tips.  A tangled mass of small, soft hairs typically cover this plant's twigs and lower leaf surfaces.  Flowering buds are formed by midsummer and remain a prominent feature of this plant after its autumnal leaf drop.  Immediately preceding or occurring with the new leaves in early spring, innumerable clusters of tubular, fragrant flowers completely cover the plant.  Because of the shape of its corolla and its floral fragrance, this plant is sometimes called honeysuckle azalea.  Colors of the petals vary from nearly white to a deep pink, depending on the genetic constitution of the individual.  Wild azalea grows well in cultivation in moist, sandy acid soil and needs a sunny location to flower profusely."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 70</abstract>
