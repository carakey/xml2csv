   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Fruits of Carolina buckthorn are an outstanding and colorful feature of this small tree.  The small, grape-sized, berrylike drupes are at first red and then black.  Because the drupes mature at different times, various colors are typically present in each cluster.  Flowers of this species are rather small and five-merous with yellowish green petals.  Their bright green color, elliptical shape, and prominent veins make Carolina buckthorn leaves attractive and distinctive.  Found throughout the southeastern United States, this species grows in the understory and at the borders of rich, moist, deciduous woodlands.  The largest individual tree is reported to be nearly fifty feet tall; most trees, however, rarely attain thirty feet.  Although little used as a landscape plant, Carolina buckthorn has considerable potential for this purpose.  Rhamus is a genus of about one hundred species widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions.  Some species are used in the manufacture of dyes, others have medicinal uses, and a few are cultivated ornamentals."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 194</abstract>
