   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Vast areas of brackish or fresh coastal marsh are predominantly occupied by lance-leaved bulltongue (right), which also grows in ditches and along ponds and streams mostly in southern Louisiana.  The plants are conspicuous not only by their numbers but also by their upright, lanceolate to elliptic, long-petiolate leaves, which arise from stout rhizomes rooted in the mud.  Tall flower stalks surpassing the leaves bear two kinds of unisexual flowers in whorls of three.  Pollen-producing flowers with many yellow stamens compose the upper portion of the inflorescence, and seed-producing flowers with a large number of green pistils the lower.  Both types of flowers have a superficially similar appearance, with three sepals and three, broadly elliptic, delicate, white petals.  Eight of the approximately twenty mostly New World species of Sagittaria are reported for Louisiana.  Most species are relatively common, wetlands plants and provide an important source of wildlife food.  Roots of S. latifolia, arrowhead, were eaten by Native Americas, and an Asian species, S. sagittifolia, is grown for its edible, starchy, underground parts."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 2</abstract>
