   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Red iris is one of the showy wildflowers commonly found along the margins of marshes and bayous in southern Louisiana.  As in most species of iris, the perianth of Iris fulva consists of six petal-like members; the outer three are called falls, and the inner three, standards.  In red iris, the standards and the falls tend to hang down.  The petal-like style branches form the central part of the flower and conceal the stamens.  Typically, the flowers are a rusty red, but yellow-brown and pinkish forms have been observed.  The seed pods are six-angled, elliptical in outline and about two inches long.  Red iris plants normally grow from two to four feet in height and bear strap-shaped leaves approximately one foot long.  First discovered in the New Orleans vicinity in the early nineteenth century, the red iris was sent to England, where it caused quite a sensation, because it was the first iris species of this color known to science.  In the wild, the red iris hybridizes rather freely with several of the blue-flowered species to produce a vast array of color forms.  Many of these variations have been taken into cultivation and propagated."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 86</abstract>
