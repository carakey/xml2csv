   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Long, tubular, funnel-shaped, white, blue, or pink corollas are the trademark of Ruellia, a genus of about two hundred species found mostly in the American tropics and subtropics.  Their resemblance to petunia is superficial, because the latter belongs in the nightshade family (Solanaceae).  For Louisiana, six species of Ruellia have been recorded.  Violet ruellia, an upright to sprawling herb with opposite leaves, grows to about thirty inches tall.  Its inflorescences, terminal racemes of several flowers with five-lobed, lavender to violet corollas having four stamens attached within, appear in the summer.  Several seeds attached to hooklike projections are formed in the two-parted, capsular fruit.  The acanthus family, comprising about 2,500 species, is primarily tropical in distribution.  Some species of Aphelandra, Crossandra, and Thunbergia (black-eyed susan), are cultivated as ornamentals.  Acanthus leaves are said to have provided the motif for the Corinthian capitals in classical Greek temples."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 1</abstract>
