   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Sweetly fragrant, white racemes of flowers are one of the attractions of this shrub that grows in wet pine savannas, baygalls, and bogs.  The flowers, five-merous and radially symmetric, have a rather simple structure.  The shrub's undivided leaves are alternate and resemble those of Alnus (alder), as suggested by the specific epithet for this species.  Sweet pepperbush generally forms thickets as new shoots arise form spreading rhizomes.  The many-branched, upright stems may attain twelve feet in height and are covered by a thin, reddish bark.  Clethra grows readily under various conditions that may be a major garden attraction through out the seasons.  This handsome shrub attracted the attention of early collectors who came to North America.  The plant was first illustrated in Leonard Plukenet's Phytographiâ€¦, published in London in 1691, and it was included by Mark Catesby in his two-volume work The Nature History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands, Volume One, Part Four, published in 1731."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.62</abstract>
