   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Although a great diversity of habits occurs in Louisiana, visions of this state usually include vast swamps of picturesque cypress trees draped with Spanish moss. Appropriately, then, bald cypress has been designated the state tree.  This tree is widely recognized by its knees and its deciduous branches bearing short, needlelike leaves and spherical seed cones.  The smaller, pollen-bearing cones are supported in dense, drooping clusters and usually appear in January or February, long before the appearance of the bright green leaves.  The function of the knees is as yet not completely clear to plant scientists, who suggest they might be pneumatophores (breathing organs), food storage depots, or a means of supporting such huge trees in the soft, wet muck of the swamp.  There is also controversy about the taxonomic status of bald cypress because two forms can be found.  Do we have one variable species, one species with two varieties, or two species?  The most obvious difference between the two entities is the spread of the leaves; plants with leaves closely appressed to the stem are sometimes referred to as pond cypress, Taxodium ascendens.  The national champion bald cypress, with a circumference of fifty-three feet eight inches and a height of eighty-three feet, is found on Cat Island, located in a relatively remote region of West Feliciana Parish."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 206</abstract>
