   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Wild hydrangea is widespread in the deciduous forests of the eastern United States.  It is known from only a few localities in Louisiana, which is on the southwestern edge of this species range.  Wild hydrangea is generally a shrub, but it may have weak stems that trail along the ground and root at the nodes.  Bark of the older, larger stems is brown and, when it exfoliates, forms thin, papery patches.  Leaves of wild hydrangea are opposite and simple, with mostly ovate blades, conspicuously serrate margins, and lighter green, somewhat-pubescent lower surfaces.  At the ends of the branches are fairly large, convex clusters with a mixture of tiny fertile and sterile flowers.  The sterile flowers develop on the ends of the inflorescence clusters and consist of three to four broadly elliptic, petal-like sepals.  Beneath the sterile flowers are the fertile ones, which are bisexual with a fivemerous perianth and eight to ten stamens.  The strongly ribbed ovary forms a brown, cup-shaped capsule.  Wild hydrangea is readily distinguished from oakleaf hydrangea, which sometimes grows in the same habitat, by its unlobed leaves and convex inflorescence.  Wild hydrangea makes an interesting plant in the shade garden, and various selections with more numerous, showy, sterile flowers are available."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 200</abstract>
