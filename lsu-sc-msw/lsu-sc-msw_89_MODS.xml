   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Found throughout eastern North America, the jack-in-the-pulpit is probably one of the most widely recognized wildflowers. In this coastal species, the spathe is green and the primary leaf is divided into five leaflets. In the more northerly jack-in-the-pulpit, A. triphyluum, the spathe is purple and the primary leaf if composed of three leaflets. Scarlet clusters of fruit, along with the withered leaves of the native American species, are commonly found on the forest floor in autumn. The underground corm, when properly prepared, may be eaten; raw corms, however, contain calcium oxalate crystals that cause an intense burning sensation in the mouth and throat. Jack-in-the-pulpit is an excellent plant for a natural shade garden provided the soil is rich and constantly moist."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.5</abstract>
