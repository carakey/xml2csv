   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Sourwood is well known throughout the eastern United States for its showy clusters of flowers and its brilliant fall foliage.  The bark of the older trunks of this medium sized tree in the heath family is dark and deeply furrowed.  Its deciduous sour-tasting, simple leaves are bright medium green in summer and turn a brilliant scarlet to reddish purple in autumn.  Clusters of slightly arching inflorescence branches, aligned along their lower sides with many small flowers, droop from the twig tips in late spring.  Within the urn-shaped corollas, pollen and nectar are produced, providing a valuable source of honey.  "Sourwood honey for sale" signs are commonly seen on a drive through the Blue Ridge of the mid-Atlantic states.  Although pendulous when in flower, the pedicels grow to an upright position as the capsules mature.  Sourwood is a desirable landscape plant, though it is difficult to grow in the lower part of Louisiana because of the lack of well-drained soils."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 55</abstract>
