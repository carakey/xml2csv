   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"The rayless goldenrod is one of the many diverse species associated with pitcher plants in the bogs and the wet pine savannas of the Gulf Coast.  This species is easily recognized during its flowering season in the late summer and fall.  The plant grows to no more than two feet in height and characteristically produces a rosette of leaves that widen toward their apices.  Several stems, which become many-branched upwardly, arise within the basal rosette and bear numerous threadlike leaves.  This plant's flat-topped inflorescence consists of innumerable small heads composed of from two to five yellow disk flowers.  As indicated by the common name, this species lacks the strap-shaped ray flowers often found in members of the sunflower family.  Bigelowia, a genus of only two species, grows mostly in the southeastern United States."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 8</abstract>
