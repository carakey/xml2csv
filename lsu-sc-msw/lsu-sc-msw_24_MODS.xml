   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Rich woodlands at higher latitudes of eastern North America abound with this representative of the poppy family that flowers in early spring.  Northern Louisiana, where only a few populations of bloodroot are known, represents the southernmost point in the geographic range of this northern plant.  The delicate nature of bloodroot offers several admirable qualities from the time its palmately divided, blue-green leaves unfold and its short-lived flowers drop their many creamy white petals until the formation of its narrowly elliptic, upright capsules.  Both its generic and its common names denote the reddish sap profusely exuded by injured rhizomes.  During the past few years, Sanguinaria has practically become a household word because of the discovery of a substance from its roots that, when used as a toothpaste additive, helps control dental plaque.  Bloodroot is an interesting ornamental if planted in a natural wooded setting.  The Papaveraceae, a family of about 250 species of mostly north temperate distribution, includes many popular ornamentals such as prickly poppies and the California poppies.  The many alkaloids produced by the opium poppy, P. somniferum, are of great medicinal value."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 155</abstract>
