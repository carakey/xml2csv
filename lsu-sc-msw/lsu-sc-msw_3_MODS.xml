   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Typically a shrub, or occasionally reaching tree size, American snowbell grows in moist to wet habitats with standing water, such as swamps and wet woodlands.  This species differs from the big leaf snowbell in a number of features besides habitat preference.  The leaves of American snowbell are somewhat smaller, and its pendulous flowers occur singly or in pairs in the axils of the leaves and at the tips of short branches.  Like those of its sister species, American snowbell flowers have recurved tips and ten yellow stamens closely clustered around the downward-pointing style.  This species possesses double buds at each node.  It appears to be more tolerant of different soils, and if planted in a somewhat sunny location, it will flower abundantly.  Propagation of this plant is somewhat difficult but normally is achieved by germinating seeds or by air-layering branches.  American snowbell is fairly common throughout Louisiana."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 204</abstract>
