   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"A profusion of bright yellow blooms is provided each fall by the tall goldenrod in roadside ditches and old fields and along the borders of woods.  This robust, perennial plant readily grows in disturbed habitats and later gives way to other types of vegetation, thus representing an early successional species.  It rapidly spreads by means of rhizomes, establishing large colonies.  Its leafy, aerial stems may grow to seven feet in height and become many branched in the inflorescence.  Close examination of the flowering heads shows that they each contain several small ray and disk flowers.  Sometimes growing with the rough-leaved tall goldenrod is a similar species, seaside goldenrod, which has smooth leaves and somewhat-larger flowers.  Goldenrod is often, though wrongfully, thought to be a common cause of allergies; its pollen, however, is carried by bees and is not airborne.  The goldenrods happen to bloom at the same time as ragweed and marsh elder, both notorious for their allergenic properties.  Solidago is represented in Louisiana by nearly twenty additional species, including several rare ones."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 45</abstract>
