   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"This small and rather shy plant of the sandy pinewoods of western Louisiana and adjoining states has suffered the misfortune of having a treacherous nomenclatural history.  This plant has been known in botanical publication by the name Eustylis purpurea for many years, but research has shown that Alophia drummondii, a name in general use for the meadow lily, is its proper name. The attractive, delicate velvety purple flowers of the pinewoods lily consist of three broad sepals and three somewhat-smaller petals flecked and banded with yellow, gold, and reddish brown.  The short-lived flowers open one at a time over successive days and are borne atop somewhat-smaller petals flecked and banded with yellow, gold, and reddish brown.  The short-lived flowers open one at a time over successive days and are borne atop somewhat-zigzag stems supporting narrow, pleated leaves.  Underground is an ovoid bulb covered with dark brown scales."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.82</abstract>
