   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"White water lily is one of the most common and best known of our aquatic plants.  It is commonly found growing in ponds, lakes, and ditches from Arizona northward to eastern Canada.  A substantial rhizome system generally forms on the substrate beneath the water.  Often called "lily pads," the floating leaf blades are circular and about ten inches in diameter.  The cup-shaped, generally fragrant, floating flowers are composed of numerous petals; the inner ones are transitional to the many yellow stamens.  On sunny days, the flowers open wide during morning hours but close in the afternoon.  Upon pollination by insects, the flowers close and the flower stalks coil, withdrawing the young fruit below the water's surface, where it matures.  The genus Nymphaea comprises approximately fifty species, which grow in temperate and tropical regions.  Numerous hybrids and plants in a variety of color selections are grown as ornamentals, but the use of native species for this purpose should not be overlooked."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 136</abstract>
