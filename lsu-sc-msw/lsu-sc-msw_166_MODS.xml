   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Considered by many to be one of the most elegant of our native flowering trees, the silky camellia represents one of the few species in this country belonging to the tea or camellia family.  This small tree, which is found on rich, wooded slopes mostly of the coastal plain from eastern Texas to Virginia, may grow to twenty feet tall.  Its simple, alternate, two-ranked leaves are abundantly covered with silky hairs. In silky camellia, four petals of each flower are white, sometimes with purple markings, while the fifth usually bears a greenish splotch; its numerous filaments are purple and support bluish anthers.  The fruit of this species, a somewhat-roundish capsule, contains lustrous, lenticular seeds.  Silky camellia, known from about a half-dozen parishes, is relatively uncommon in Louisiana.  Although this species would be a highly desirable ornamental, it evidently cannot tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions.  The camellia family is abundantly represented in our area by a plethora of cultivars of camellia and sasanqua.  Camellia sinensis, native to southeastern Asia, is the source of commercial tea and is widely grown in many areas of the world."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 182</abstract>
