   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Well known for its valuable wood used in making furniture and cabinets, black cherry is a common forest tree found throughout much of eastern North America.  Bark on the younger branches characteristically shows horizontal silvery bands, and the older bark is an irregular patchwork of plates.  In the vegetative state, this plant can be readily recognized by a line of reddish hairs along either side of the midvein on the lower side of its simple, alternate leaves.  Its individual, white, plumlike flowers are arranged in cylindrical racemes.  Five small sepals subtend the five white petals surrounding the twenty or so stamens.  The cherries, which develop from the single simple pistil, are purplish black and usually less than one-half inch in diameter.  Their flavor may vary from bitter to sweet, depending on the individual tree.  Black cherry may grow quite large.  The national champion, located in Michigan, is 132 feet tall."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 174</abstract>
