   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Horned bladder wort grows in water, in floating mats, and on land.  When growing in a terrestrial habitat, it has creeping stems near the soil surface, and its narrow, simple, filiform leaves can be seen only if the soil is gently washed away from the stems.   Its bladders, or traps, are minute and are borne along the leaf margins.  Upright scapes to about one foot tall appear from summer to fall and normally support from one to as many as nine flowers.  Its bright yellow corollas are about one inch wide with a helmet shaped lower lip and a down turned spur about one-half inch long.  Horned bladderwort grows in the shallow water of ponds and ditches and in the wet soil of bogs and wet pinewoods of the eastern United States and southeastern Canada.  Utricularia is a large, worldwide genus of mostly aquatic or wetland plants, but some South American species grow as epiphytes.  Approximately ten other species of bladderworts are known to grow in Louisiana."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 104</abstract>
