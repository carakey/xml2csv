   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Uncommon and perhaps often overlooked, this curious, delicate little annual of the rich, moist woodlands and bogs of the Gulf Coastal Plain is a saprophyte.  It derives its nutrition from decaying vegetation, much as do certain fungi.  Threadlike stems and small, scaly leaves lack the green color created by the presence of chlorophyll (found in plants that make their own food photosynthetically) and instead may be pigmented with shades of lavender to purple.  The relatively large, white to sometimes purple, bell-shaped flowers, which appear in autumn, give way to capsules containing numerous tiny seeds."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.48</abstract>
