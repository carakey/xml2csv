   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Showy displays of the red milkweed are found in early summer in the wet pine savannas and swamps of the southeastern United States. The rarely branched stems are upright and bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The bicolored flowers, with orange coronas and reflexed, red petals, are striking features of this species. Characteristic of most milkweeds, the fruit is a pod, called a follicle, filled with many silky haired seeds."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.22</abstract>
