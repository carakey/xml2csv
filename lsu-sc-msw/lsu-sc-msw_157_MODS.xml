   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"The roughleaf dogwood and the flowering dogwood constitute our two common native species of Cornus.  Both are small trees that have simple, opposite leaves with conspicuous, arching, secondary veins.  Major differences between the two species are seen in the floral and fruiting structures.  Individually, the flowers of the roughleaf dogwood are more showy, but the inflorescences lack the large white or pink bracts associated with the flower clusters of the flowering dogwood.  Fruits of the roughleaf are white to bluish, not the familiar scarlet red of the other species.  Roughleaf dogwood grows in a variety of habitats but is more common in wetter, heavier soils.  It was named for its discoverer, Thomas Drummond."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 52</abstract>
