   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Goldcrest grows in the bogs and wet pine savannas of the coastal plain from Louisiana to the northeastern United States.  Its irislike leaves arise from white to brownish rhizomes.  A single flowering stalk bears reduced leaves upwardly and a many-branched inflorescence at its apex.  Its numerous, small, bisexual flowers possess six stamens and a three-carpellate pistil with a capitate stigma.  Six segments of equal length constitute the perianth.  The inner surfaces of both the sepals and the petals are bright yellow and are covered with numerous hairs, which also densely clothe the inflorescence stalk and branches.  Goldcrest and the related redroot are the only members of the bloodwort family growing in Louisiana.  Most plants in this family are found in the Southern Hemisphere."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 80</abstract>
