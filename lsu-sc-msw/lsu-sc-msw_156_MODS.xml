   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Masses of rose vervain offer intense springtime floral displays in sandy fields and open pinelands and along roadsides.  Slightly convex clusters crowded with flowers develop at the tips of the sprawling stems of this perennial plant.  True to its vervain character, the slender corolla tube abruptly expands into five lobes, exhibiting a slight degree of bilateral symmetry.  Included within the corolla tube are two pairs of stamens inserted at two different levels.  Opposite, deeply lacerate leaves are attached at regular intervals to the four-angled stems.  Rose vervain and a few other species are planted for their showy flowers.  Gladnularia is often included within Verbena, a genus of approximately two hundred species distributed throughout much of the Americas."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 140</abstract>
