   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Compared with the fringed orchids in Louisiana, the yellow fringeless orchid is smaller and differs in several floral features.  Its racemes of golden yellow flowers appear from mid-to late summer, and they are conical in the bud stage and cylindrical when in flower.  Unlike the fringed orchids, this plant has a floral lip with a margin that is merely scalloped, and the specific name integra describes this condition.  The lateral sepals spread at right angles to the lip and to the dorsal sepal, which arches over and surrounds the lateral petals and the column of the flower.  Yellow fringeless orchid closely resembles Platanthera cristata, the crested orchid, which grows in similar habitats.  Yellow fringeless orchid is known to grow in only four or five locations in Louisiana.  It is one of the many rare species of plants that grow in boglike habitats, giving additional support to their significance as a home for unusual flora."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 153</abstract>
