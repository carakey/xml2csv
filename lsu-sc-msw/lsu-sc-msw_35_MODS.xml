   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"The richness of its vivid scarlet flowers indeed rivals that of a cardinal's breeding plumage.  One of our most recognized wildflowers, cardinal flower generally grows along streams in moist, shady woods.  The two-lipped flowers are borne on upright racemes that appear in late summer and fall.  Projecting from the two-lobed upper lip and surrounding the style is a collar of five purplish anthers.  Such a configuration places the pollen in a position where it can be deposited on the heads of hummingbirds and butterflies as they collect nectar from within the corollas; the pollen is then transferred to other flowers.  Because of its increasing rarity, cardinal flower should never be transplanted from the wild.  It can be readily propagated from seeds or stem cuttings.  Once the cardinal flower is established in the garden, its side shoots, which develop at the base of the current season's withering stem, must not be covered by fallen leaves or mulch.  These new shoots must receive sunlight in order to live and produce the following year's growth."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 49</abstract>
