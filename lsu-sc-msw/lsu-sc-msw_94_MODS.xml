   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Autumn's last splash of color in Louisiana is spent on the late blue aster, which is seen around the edges of woods, along roadsides, and in old fields. Profuse masses of yellow- to purple-centered, pale blue-rayed heads cause the slender stems to arch over and to often rely on neighboring vegetation for support. The late blue aster is a widespread perennial in the eastern United States and is one of more than two dozen native species of aster found in Louisiana."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.8</abstract>
