   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"In southeastern Louisiana, the boughs of live oak and southern magnolia commonly provide suitable habitat for the slender, creeping rhizomes and numerous roots of the green-fly orchid.  This species is epiphytic, not parasitic, since its nutrients are obtained from the rainwater in which it bathes.  The aerial stems typically bear two or three dark green leaves and may terminate with a cluster of as many as twenty yellowish green flowers.  Except for the three-lobed lip, each perianth segment has a linear to oblanceolate shape.  Numerous tiny seeds are produced in each ellipsoidal capsule.  The green-fly orchid ranges from east Texas to North Carolina and southward into Florida.  It is the only epiphytic orchid in the Western Hemisphere that grows north of Florida."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 150</abstract>
