   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Spectacular clusters of bright, reddish orange, trumpet-shaped flowers announce the presence of trumpet creeper, a common, vigorous, woody vine of fencerows and woodland borders.  The stems, which may grow to as much as fifty feet in length, attach themselves to tree trunks and masonry walls by means of aerial roots.  This species possesses opposite, pinnately compound leaves with seven to ten coarsely toothed leaflets.  Trumpet creeper, like its relatives the crossvine and the catalpa, bears long, slender fruits paced with numerous, papery, winged seeds.  Trumpet creeper is cultivated for its flowers and nectar, which attract hummingbirds."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.47</abstract>
