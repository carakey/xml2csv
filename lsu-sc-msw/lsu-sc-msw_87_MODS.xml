   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Vivid, red, trumpet-shaped flowers with yellow inner surfaces typify the Indian pink, which inhabits rich, moist, somewhat shady woods throughout the Southeast.  Indian pink grows up to two feet tall and produces several pairs of opposite, simple leaves along its upright, unbranched stems.  Its five-merous flowers are arranged in a terminal, one-sided spike with the oldest flowers at the base and progressively younger ones towards the apex.  Indian pink, a favorite of native-plant gardeners, returns from its underground rhizome year after year, consistently producing its floral display.  It was an early introduction to England and was discussed in Philip Miller's Gardeners Dictionary, published in several editions prior to 1797.  Spigelia, a genus of about fifty species that grow in the Western Hemisphere, is represented in this country by about three other species.  Some botanists treat Spigelia as belonging to its own family, but more commonly it is placed in the Loganiaceae.  This largely tropical family is represented in Louisiana by yellow jessamine and a few other species.  Buddleja, a popular ornamental, and Strychnos, the source of the highly toxic strychnine, are often considered members of the logania family."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 141</abstract>
