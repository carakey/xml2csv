   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Rock rose is widely distributed in dry, sandy, upland soils throughout much of Louisiana and the southeastern United States.  These hairy stemmed, small plants rarely attain a height of more than twelve inches.  A basal rosette of elliptic to obovate leaves is present at least during the early part of the plant's life cycle, and similarly shaped, alternately arranged leaves are attached along the length of the stem.  One to a few bright yellow flowers form a loosely arranged inflorescence at the shoot apex.  The flowers are composed of five sepals (the outer two are smaller than the inner three), five petals, and numerous stamens.  A many-seeded capsule develops from the ovary of the flower.  Helianthemum is a genus of approximately one hundred species.  Many of them grow throughout the Mediterranean region.  Only a few species of rock roses are native to Louisiana and the southeastern states."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 51 `</abstract>
