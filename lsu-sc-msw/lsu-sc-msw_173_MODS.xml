   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Catalpa is one of the few medium-sized trees with large, showy flowers native to Louisiana.  For a couple of weeks during springtime, this species stands out from the other vegetation along the edges of woodlands and streams.  Each broad, pyramidal flower cluster is about one foot in length.  The numerous bell-shaped flowers are one to two inches long with purple spotted, white corollas, which have two interior yellow stripes and ruffled margins.  Clusters of pods, which individually reach eighteen inches long, subsequently develop and remain on the trees for some time.  Also unique to this species are its opposite to whorled, large, heart-shaped leaves.  Southern catalpa is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value, and the tree is well known to fishermen, who claim the catalpa worms (caterpillars) are irresistible to fish."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.38</abstract>
