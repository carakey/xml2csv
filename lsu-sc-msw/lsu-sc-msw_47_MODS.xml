   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Crane fly orchid, a plant found in rich, deciduous woodlands, has an unusual life cycle.  In autumn, as the trees begin to lose their leaves and more sunlight reaches the forest floor, the crane fly orchid develops a new leaf and corm from its underground tubers.  Typically three to four inches long, this solitary leaf is deep green above, a rich, satiny purple below.  It lives until the next spring, when it withers and eventually dies.  By late summer, following a period of dormancy, the inflorescence emerges, and the upper two-thirds of its leafless axis are occupied with flowers.  Their perianth parts are colored with various shades of green and purple.  Its three sepals and two of its petals are similar in size and shape, while the lip is three-lobed and possesses a basal spur about one inch long.  The flowers, handing askew on the inflorescence, resemble crane flies.  In fact, the orchid name is based on the generic name for crane flies.  Within a large population of leaves, only a few inflorescences are seen each year, suggesting that individual plants flower infrequently."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 162</abstract>
