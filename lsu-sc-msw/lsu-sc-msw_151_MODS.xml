   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Although common in some parts of the Gulf Coastal Plain, redroot is restricted in Louisiana to Washington and St. Tammany parishes, where scattered colonies grow in low, wet savannas.  Its gradually tapering, irislike leaves arise from the base of the plant.  In flower, the plants become quite evident by their grayish, flat-topped inflorescences of numerous small flowers. The woolly perianth of the individual flowers is composed of six members; the outer three are slightly shorter than the three inner, yellow ones.  Anthers of the three stamens stand above the perianth at about the same height as the capitate stigma.  As implied by its common name, this species does indeed possess red roots and rhizomes containing a red sap.  The approximately one hundred species in the bloodwort family grow mostly in tropical regions.  An Australian plant called the kangaroo paw and a few other species are grown as ornamentals."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 95</abstract>
