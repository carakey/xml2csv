   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Whorled pogonia is a delicate perennial found along streams in rich woodlands throughout much of the eastern United States.  Although generally regarded as rare to uncommon, this orchid may often be overlooked because of its short stature and inconspicuous but large flowers.  A single, upright, hollow stem about ten inches tall typically supports a whorl of five leaves and one large flower borne on a relatively long pedicel.  Each of the three slender, spreading sepals is about two inches long and purplish.  The column, a specialized structure composed of the stamens and the pistil, is surrounded by the lateral petals and the lip.  Both lateral petals are a pale yellowish green, the same color as the central part of the lip, which is also edged in purple.  Whorled pogonia's early springtime appearance has been recorded in several central and northern parishes in Louisiana.  Plants seen in the vegetative condition in St. Tammany Parish also appear to be this species.  Colonies of whorled pogonia are reported to lie dormant for ten or more years until conditions become conducive for flowering."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 151</abstract>
