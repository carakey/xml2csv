   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Beard-tongue, a name in general use for this and other species of the genus, refers to the toothbrush-shaped, sterile stamen or staminode found within the corolla.  Among the five species of Penstemon known to grow naturally in Louisiana, P. tenuis is one that is commonly encountered.  Its natural habitat includes the edges of bottomland forests, low prairies, and wet, disturbed areas.  It is one of our four species with essentially white corollas often tinged with blue or purple.  In habit, P. tenuis is similar to the red penstemon, and though much less colorful, it is nevertheless attractive, especially when growing in mass.  Distinguishing it from the other native species depends on recognizing a number of rather trivial features such as the serration along the leaf margins and the size, shape, and pubescence of the corolla and the staminode.  Although not readily available for cultivation, native beard-tongues offer considerable potential as garden ornamentals, and they may become as popular here as they are in other parts of the country."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 203</abstract>
