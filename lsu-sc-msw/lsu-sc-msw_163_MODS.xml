   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Profusely branched stems and tiny flowers impart a delicate, lacy appearance to this perennial herb.  Long petiolate leaves, whose blades are speckled with tiny salt glands, arise from the base of the plant.  Its aerial, somewhat dichotomously branched stems, bearing only small, scalelike bracts, appear leafless.  Approximately a dozen flowers develop on one side of each ultimate branch.  A narrowly funnelform, five-lobed calyx subtends a similarly shaped corolla, which may vary from lavender to deep purple.  Both perianth members are scarious-that is, they are rather dry and paperlike.  Because of this quality, flowering stems are readily preserved by drying, making this plant a favorite subject for dried floral arrangements.  Sea lavender grows in wet, saline habitats along the coast of North America from northeastern Mexico to Newfoundland, Canada.  In Louisiana, this species is found only in the coastal parishes."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 188</abstract>
