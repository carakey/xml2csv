   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"The green dragon is a close relative of the jack-in-the-pulpit, and the plants are quite similar in appearance. However, green dragon's one leaf is divided into five to fifteen segments, and jack-in-the-pulpit's, three to five segments. Green dragon's spadix is long and tapering and projects from a reduced spathe (the leaflike structure that surrounds and arches over the spadix of tiny, pollen- and seed-bearing flowers). Green dragon and jack-in-the-pulpit frequently grow together in mixed populations in moist, open woods with abundant leaf litter. Both species also have small underground corms containing calcium oxalate crystals and produce clusters of scarlet red fruit in the autumn."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.4</abstract>
