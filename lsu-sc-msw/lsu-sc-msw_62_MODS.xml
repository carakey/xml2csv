   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Fetterbush is a handsome, evergreen shrub generally found in lighter soils around bogs, bays, and swamps.  Its gracefully arching, strongly angled, leafy branches support simple, alternate, dark green, glossy leaves whose undersides are paler and more abundantly covered with minute, punctuate dots.  Its entire leaf margins are somewhat revolute and characterized by a marginal vein.  In the early spring, abbreviated clusters of flowers blossom from the leaf axils of the previous season's stems.  Each of the somewhat pendant flowers is composed of a small, five-lobed calyx and an urn-shaped corolla, which may range in color from white to nearly red.  The globose capsule contains many small seeds.  Fetterbush may be propagated by seeds and cuttings, but in cultivation it will perform well only in habitats approximating those found in nature."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 55</abstract>
