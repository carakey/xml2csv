   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"When he named this plant in 1834, Thomas Nuttal referred to it as the largest and finest Spiranthes in the United States, a distinction it still holds.  Fragrant ladies' tresses grow in wet woods, marshes, and wet prairies from Texas to Virginia.  Its narrowly oblanceolate leaves are mostly borne along the lower half of its slender stems, which may attain heights of three feet.  According to some observers, its creamy white flowers, which are arranged in several vertical ranks, have a vanilla-like fragrance that intensifies during the evening hours.  Each flower, subtended by a floral bract, is composed of three sepals that resemble the two upper petals.  The lower petal is modified into the larger, reflexed lip and has a yellowish center and a somewhat crenulate margin.  Within the connivent perianth parts is the column composed of the modified anthers, the stigma, and the style.  Spiranthes, a genus of about two hundred species, is widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, tropical Asia, and Chile.  Approximately ten other species have been reported for Louisiana."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 154</abstract>
