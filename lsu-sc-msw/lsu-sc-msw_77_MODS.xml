   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"'Gift of the meadow' is the meaning of Limodorum, a Greek name first used for this plant that grows in sunny wet meadows and savannas.  This little orchid with its rose-pink to nearly crimson flowers is truly a jewel.  The lip, one of the specialized petals of the orchid flower, is uppermost in the grass pink and has a fishtail-like apical portion.  Somewhat below this is a beard of yellow hairs that arises from a white background.  The two sepals on either side of the lip are large, colorful, and petal-like.  The remaining two petals and the third sepal compose the lower portion of the flower.  The column, which comprises the stigma, style, and stamens, projects from the central part of the flower and curves upward.  For certain reasons, Calopogon is now the correct generic name for this plant and refers to the colorful beard on the lip.  The specific epithet tuberosus refers to the underground, tuberlike roots from which the shoots develop.  Although the grass pink orchid is common in parts of the southeastern United States, it is generally uncommon in Louisiana, probably being restricted by special habitat requirements."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.149</abstract>
