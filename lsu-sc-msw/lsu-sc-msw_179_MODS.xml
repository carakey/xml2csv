   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Spice bush is a frequently encountered shrub of the bottomland hardwood forests.  It is most conspicuous in the springtime, when small clusters of tiny yellow flowers appear before the leaves, and again in autumn, when the elliptical, shiny, crimson fruits mature.  Spice bush is polygamo-dioecious-that is, pollen-bearing and seed-bearing flowers grow on separate plants, but such individuals may have bisexual flowers as well.  The pollen-bearing flowers are the most conspicuous.  Their anthers, true to their familial heritage, shed pollen not simply by splitting but by opening flaplike doors.  Leaves of Lindera are simple, alternate, and elliptic in outline.  When crushed, they emit a spicy fragrance.  Chewing the twigs of this plant is said to give some relief from a sore throat.  Camphor, an ingredient in many commercial medicines, apparently is the active substance in spice bush.  The plants tolerate a broad range of growing conditions and would add an element of interest to the garden."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 102</abstract>
