   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Yellow pond lily commonly grows in the shallow, sluggish water of bayous, ditches, ponds, and swamps of Louisiana and the eastern United States.  Extensive rhizomes serve to firmly anchor the plants to the mud of such habitats.  Their dark green, broadly oval leaf blades may vary in length from ten to twenty inches, and petioles two to three times as long secure them to the rhizome.  The leaves may be immersed in water, float on its surface, or emerge from it.  Submerged leaves, however, have a generally thinner and somewhat more crisped blades than do emergent ones.  Typically, the golden yellow flowers, which float on or just below the water's surface, are tethered to the rhizome by long peduncles.  Six or more rather fleshy, concave, petal-like sepals composed the perianth, which subtends the numerous stamens.  The compound ovary forms a many-seeded fruit.  Even though these plants are called lilies, they are very distantly related; in fact, they are not monocots but dicots."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 146</abstract>
