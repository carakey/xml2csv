   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Woodland red trillium, like red trillium, has three mottled, leaflike bracts and a single, sessile, upright flower.  Woodland red trillium, however, is somewhat taller, often growing to about fifteen inches in height, and has larger bracts and larger flowers with strongly reflexed sepals, a feature noted in its specific epithet.  The flowers of the Trillium recurvatum lack the strong, unpleasant, carrionlike odor of red trillium.  Woodland red trillium has petals that bow outward in the middle and anthers that curve inward.  This species grows more abundantly in Illinois and Indiana and reaches the southern limit of its geographic range in northern Louisiana, where it has been recorded from about seven parishes.  Trillium is a genus mostly of temperate areas.  Approximately forty of its fifty species grow in North America; the remainders are found in Asia.  The genus is traditionally divided into two groups: one with stalked flowers, the other with stalkless flowers.  Four of the five species, native to Louisiana, belong to the latter group."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 118</abstract>
