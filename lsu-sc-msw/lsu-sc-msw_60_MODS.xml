   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"This wiry stemmed, diffusely branched annual grows in old fields and along the edges of woods and roadsides.  Its relatively large, intricately patterned, bell-shaped flowers undoubtedly attract the attention of even the most casual observer of the late summer flora of the southeastern United States.  Its flowers are similar in design to the well-known foxglove, which belongs to another genus in this plant family.  The fifty to sixty other species of Agalinis are similar to one another.  Positive identification of the false foxglove and its kin often tries the patience of even the professional botanist because the minute, technical features that separate the different species.  Agalinis plants are somewhat parasitic and form root attachments to various kinds of herbaceous and woody plants."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.201</abstract>
