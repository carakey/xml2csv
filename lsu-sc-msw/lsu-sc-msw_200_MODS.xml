   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Much of the attractiveness of the titi is attributed to the numerous, many-flowered racemes clustered below the alternate, simple, shiny, dark green leaves.  Its radially symmetric, fivemerous, white flowers appear in the late springtime.  The subsequently developing clusters of small, dry fruits generally persist until the next flowering season and offer a good clue to the plant's identity.  Similarly, the somewhat twisted and gnarled trunk with reddish cinnamon bark adds distinction and attractiveness to this plant.  Titi is a dominant shrub or small tree along streams and in the bay head swamps of southeastern and west central Louisiana.  It also grows throughout the southeastern United States, the West Indies, and northern South America, where it may become a fairly large tree."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 53</abstract>
