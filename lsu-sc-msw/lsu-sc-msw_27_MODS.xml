   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Undoubtedly the blue mist flower, which grows along the edges of woods and in wet meadows and roadside ditches, is one of the most conspicuous of the autumn wildflowers.  Its numerous compactly clustered heads of disk flowers have bright, ageratum blue corollas.  Their elongated branches give the flower clusters a diffuse, misty appearance.  The specific epithet coelestinum means heavenly and refers to the attractiveness of this plant's floral features.  The opposite leaves of this species typically exhibit long petioles and triangular leaf blades.  Blue mist flower may be planted in the garden or allowed to proliferate in natural settings.  Its habit is perennial, and it may be propagated by root cuttings or from seed."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 11</abstract>
