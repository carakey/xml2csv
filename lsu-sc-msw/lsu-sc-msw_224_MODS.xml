   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"In central and northern Louisiana, isolated patches of alkaline soils restrict tree growth, allowing prairielike vegetation to flourish.  In this region, the wind flower is one of the earliest wildflowers to appear among the brownish mats of last season's grasses and prairie herbs.  The showy, solitary flowers appear on stems from a few to several inches tall, lack petals, but have from ten to twenty strap-shaped, white to rose sepals.  The outer ones are lavender to dark purple beneath.  The leaves number from one to three and are divided into narrow segments.  Each cone-shaped flower produces scores of densely pubescent fruits, which erupt at maturity and form globular, woolly masses.  The wind removes the cottony propagules individually or in small aggregates and carries them away from the parent plant."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.193</abstract>
