   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Although yellow fringed orchid is known to exist in a number of localities throughout much of Louisiana, it is nevertheless uncommon.  This species grows mainly in bogs and wet pine savannas, where its apricot-colored flowers dot the late-summer landscape.  Roots of this plant are tuberous, and each plant typically develops a single, upright stem with two to four glossy green leaves.  From thirty to sixty flowers compose the terminal racemes.  As with most orchids, flowers of the yellow fringed orchid have three sepals and three petals.  The cup-shaped dorsal sepal nearly conceals the tiny, fringed, lateral petals, and the other two sepals project laterally from the flower's center.  Like the white fringed orchid, this species has flowers that bear a long, curved spur and an intricately fringed, tongue-shaped lip.  Nectar secreted within the spur mainly attracts swallowtail butterflies, the plant's principal pollinator."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 160</abstract>
