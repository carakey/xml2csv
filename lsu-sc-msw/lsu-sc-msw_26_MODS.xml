   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Stately racemes of large, pale blue to violet flowers of the larkspur sit atop upright stems that bear alternate, palmately dissected leaves.  The flowers have unusual, colorful, petal-like sepals; the upper one forms a long spur in which nectar is produced.  The petals are much smaller and less showy, and the upper two may also form spurs that fit inside the spur of the upper sepal.  The ovary is three-parted, and at maturity, each segment forms an upright follicle containing many seeds.  Blue larkspur is a perennial found throughout the southeastern United States.  In Louisiana, it may grow abundantly in very restricted, specialized habitats such as the calcareous prairie openings that dot the north-central part of this state.  Delphinium, with approximately two hundred species, is a diverse genus primarily of the Northern Hemisphere.  Several species of Delphinium, including D. carolinianum, are generally available for use in ornamental plantings."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 172</abstract>
