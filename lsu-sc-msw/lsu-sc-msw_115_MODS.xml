   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Oak-leaved hydrangea, a many-branched shrub that grows to about fifteen feet in height, is characterized by its pyramidal-shaped flower clusters.  Conspicuous on the inflorescence are the sterile flowers, which have three to four showy, petal-like sepals.  These flowers are white during the spring when the plant flowers bloom, but persist and turn reddish in summer, then brown in the fall.  The fertile pollen- and seed-producing flowers are small and partially concealed by the much larger sterile ones.  The common name and the specific epithet for this species refer to the large, deeply four- or five-lobed leaves, which are shaped much like oak leaves.  Its leaves are deciduous and are densely covered beneath with silvery hairs.  The attractive, reddish brown bark of this species is smooth when young but is shed in papery, irregularly shaped plates on older stems.  Oak-leaved hydrangea grows as an understory shrub in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and on slopes of ravines in deciduous woods of the southeastern United States.  This species is often cultivated for its ornamental qualities."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 200</abstract>
