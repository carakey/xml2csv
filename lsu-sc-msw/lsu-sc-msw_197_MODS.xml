   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Leaves with the taste and smell of green apples are characteristic of sweetleaf, a common shrub or small understory tree of mesic to wet forests of the southeastern United States.  Its alternate leaves are elliptic to oblanceolate, supported by yellowish petioles, and tend to remain on the plant throughout the winter.  Sometimes galls are formed in response to a fungal infection, and from a distance these pale, yellow-green, puffy structures look like flowers.  The sweetleaf's compact, closely se inflorescences appear prior to the new leaves, near the branch tips of the previous season's growth.  Each fragrant flower has five small sepals, five creamy white petals, numerous stamens arranged in fascicles, and a single pistil with a three-parted ovary.  Sweetleaf fruits are small, elliptical drupes.  Symplocaceae contains only two genera and about five hundred species from the tropics and subtropics.  The family is sometimes included in the camellia order or placed with the ebony order.  Sweetleaf, often called horsesugar, is sometimes grown for its decorative value."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 205</abstract>
