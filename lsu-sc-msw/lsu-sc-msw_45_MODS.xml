   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Coral greenbriar is a deciduous vine that usually grows in fresh water or at least in places that are flooded for long periods of time.  Because of its aggressive growth habits, it may form impenetrable thickets.  Coral greenbriar has stems that are much less spiny than those of some of its relatives.  Blades of its leaves are green above and somewhat paler below, ovate to lanceolate-ovate in outline, and supported by short, usually reddish petioles.  Species of Smilax are dioecious, i.e., pollen-producing and fruit-bearing flowers occur on different individuals.  Both types of flowers are produced in umbels on stalks arising from the axils of the leaves.  Their perianths are composed of six greenish yellow, petal-like segments; the staminate flowers have six stamens, and the pistillate flowers have a single, three-parted pistil.  Its bright red berries persist on the plant and reach maturity after leaf fall in autumn.  Nearly a dozen species of Smilax grow in Louisiana, and several, such as catbriar, greenbriar, and bullbriar, have numerous, very sharp spines, grow in great abundance, and may make a hike in the woods an unpleasant experience."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 107</abstract>
