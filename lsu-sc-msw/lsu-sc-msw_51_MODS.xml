   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Deciduous holly is a large shrub or small tree that grows on fertile, moist soils in the understory of hardwood forests and in thickets along streams and fencerows.  Functionally, deciduous holly plants are dioecious, i.e., individuals produce either pollen or fruit.  Flowers appear in the spring either singly or in small clusters in the axils of new leaves.  Both pollen- and seed-bearing flowers have four to five small, yellowish green petals.  When fully developed, the alternate simple leaves of this species are generally broadest above the middle and have a few small teeth along their margins.  Late in the season, after the leaves have fallen and throughout the winter months, persistent, spherical red fruits give deciduous holly high visibility.  Several horticultural selections with various shades of fruit color are available for ornamental plantings."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 18</abstract>
