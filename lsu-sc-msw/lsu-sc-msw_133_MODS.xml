   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Possum haw is widely distributed in eastern North America and is found throughout most of noncoastal Louisiana.  It occurs in various wetland habitats such as swamps, bays, and wet woodlands.  This large shrub or small tree may grow to nearly twenty feet tall.  Possum haw is readily characterized by its opposite, smooth-margined, relatively short, petiolate leaves.  Rusty scales generally are seen on leaf undersides, petioles, and young twigs.  Flowers of the possum haw are arranged in somewhat-rounded, compact clusters that may be up to six inches in diameter.  Each flower has five very small sepals, a pale, yellowish white corolla of five partially fused petals, and five stamens.  The elliptical, deep blue fruits are covered with a whitish bloom.  If possum haw receives full sunlight, it is practically covered with attractive flower clusters.  The unpleasant odor emitted by the flowers limits the use of this species as a garden ornamental.  Six other species of Viburnum are native to Louisiana, and several exotic ones are grown ornamentally."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 50</abstract>
