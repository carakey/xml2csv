   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Coral bean is naturally distributed in sandy woodlands throughout the southeastern United States and northeastern Mexico.  This species is herbaceous in the colder parts of its range but becomes shrubby in frost-free areas.  Recurved prickles may be borne on the stems and on various parts of its trifoliate leaves, which have broadly triangular to hastately lobed leaflets.  In the late spring, spires of red, leguminous flowers are displayed atop upright stems.  The somewhat-cylindrical, red corollas are approximately two inches long.  The most distinctive feature of this species is the scarlet, bean-like seeds displayed along the margins of the opened, dark brown pods.  Most of the approximately forty species of Erythrina are tropical trees with showy flowers."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 59</abstract>
