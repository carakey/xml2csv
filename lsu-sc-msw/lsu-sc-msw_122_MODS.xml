   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Notorious for its astringent fruits, persimmon is a common, well-known tree found in various predominantly upland habitats.  Although the orange, soft-textured, fully ripened fruits are flavorful, they provide little substance because of their numerous, large seeds.  Nevertheless, persimmons may be an important wildlife food.  The trees are functionally dioecious-that is, individuals produce either fruit or pollen-and both types must be growing near one another for successful fruit production.  Pollen- and fruit-producing flowers are superficially similar in size and have greenish yellow, four- to five-lobed, bell-shaped corollas.  Other characteristics that serve to identify the persimmon include its dark, checkered trunks and its simple, alternate, smooth-margined leaves borne on short stalks and usually covered on the undersides with small, soft hairs."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 54</abstract>
