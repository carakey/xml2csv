   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"The lady lupine has magnificent, tall spikes of showy flowers that arise in clusters from dense clumps of greenish gray leaves.  Being a typical member of the legume family, lady lupine has flowers that consist of a keel, two wing petals, and a lavender banner with a dark purple spot.  Lady lupine is a perennial herb with unifoliate leaves, and unusual feature for lupines, which generally have compound leaves with numerous leaflets.  Its fruits are similar in structure to those of peas.  An abundance of hairs gives the vegetative parts of the plants and the fruits a shaggy, silvery gray appearance. Lupinus villosus grows in sandy soils of the coastal plain from Florida to Louisiana, where it is known from a few locations in Washington and St. Tammany parishes.  Some species of Lupinus are popular ornamental plants, and this species seems to have such potential as well, but little apparently is known about its culture characteristics.  The generic name Lupinus comes from the Latin lupus, "wolf," because a crop of lupines was thought to destroy soil fertility.  About two hundred species of lupines are known to occur mostly in temperate regions of the world."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 74</abstract>
