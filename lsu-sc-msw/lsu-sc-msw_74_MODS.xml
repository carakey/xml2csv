   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Spreading, subterranean rhizomes give rise to colonies of golden canna, a plant that grows in swamps and marshes scattered about Louisiana and the southeastern United States.  Racemes of large yellow flowers sit atop stems that may reach six feet in height.  Golden canna leaves are large and elliptic, much like the ones of cultivated cannas.  The six perianth parts are yellow and petal-like, as are two of the three stamens and the style.  Only one of the three stamens bears pollen.  The ovary, being inferior, develops below the showy parts of the flower and forms a three lobed, green fruit covered with succulent protuberances.  The cannas popular in cultivation are generally red-flowered and represent the Asian species Canna indica, which has become naturalized and occasionally can be seen in the south Louisiana marshes."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.42</abstract>
