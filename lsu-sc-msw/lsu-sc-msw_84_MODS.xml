   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Hydrolea, a rhizomatous herbaceous species, grows along the margins of swamps and in wet ditches, where it may form extensive colonies.  When in bloom, its showy clusters of brilliant blue flowers attract considerable attention.  Hydrolea's bell-shaped corollas are composed of five petals that are about one-half inch in length.  The five anthers of each flower are supported by long, arching filaments that attach to the corolla tube by dilated glandular bases.  Individuals eager to pick one of these attractive plants are rudely surprised by sharp spines associated with each of the plant's ovate leaves.  Hydrolea is a genus of about twenty species found primarily in tropical America."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 97</abstract>
