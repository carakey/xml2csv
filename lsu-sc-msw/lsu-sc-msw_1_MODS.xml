   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Certain rich, beech-magnolia wooded hillsides in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, represent the southwestern extent of the geographic distribution of Allegheny spurge.  Propagating by horizontal stems, this species forms large colonies on the forest floor.  The mottled, variegated leaves, an outstanding feature of this plant, occur only near the upturned branch tips.  The rather small, imperfect flowers are clustered together in spikes about three inches long that arise from the base of the leafy stems.  The inflorescence varies from being composed entirely of all pollen-producing flowers to having a few seed-producing ones below the staminate flowers.  Both the male and the female perianths consist of four sepals and no petals.  A three-horned capsule develops from the female flower.  Literally, and in reference to the four white, fleshy filaments of each male flower, pachysandra means "having thick, pollen-bearing structures." In appropriate habitats Allegheny spurge provides an attractive ground cover.  World wide, approximately one hundred species compose the box family including the often-used hedge plant, boxwood."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 49</abstract>
