   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Characteristic of the prairies and open, wooded hillsides of the central United States, the pale coneflower grows in western Louisiana.  Its rather rough stems may reach three feet in height.  The greatest concentration of leaves is at each stem's base and the leaves become progressively smaller and fewer along the stem.  The central, cone-shaped disk of each head consists of many tiny, dark-lobed disk flowers.  Associated with each flower of the disk are spiny tipped bracts, alluded to by the genus name Echinacea.  Surrounding the disk and giving color and elegance to the flower cluster are several evenly spaced ray flowers with long, narrow, pale purple, drooping petals.  Pale coneflower and some of the other nine species in this genus are often planted as garden flowers.  Some investigators give species recognition (based largely on features of the chromosomes) to populations from Louisiana and adjacent states as E. sanguinea Nutt."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 10</abstract>
