   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Ground nut, a common twining vine found in stream and pond margins, has dark green, pinnately compound leaves and dense clusters of papilionaceous flowers.  The banner is white on the outside and purple to reddish brown on the inner surface.  The less conspicuous wing and keel petals exhibit similar colors.  The intricately shaped flowers exhibit a peculiar tripping mechanism to aid pollination by certain bee species.  Beneath the ground are strings of storage tubers, once used for food by Native Americans.  The seeds of this plant are also edible.  Researchers are looking at the feasibility of cultivating this species for food, as has been done with many of its relatives in the legume family."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.57</abstract>
