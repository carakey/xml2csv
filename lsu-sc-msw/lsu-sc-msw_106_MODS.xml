   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"The gregarious colonies of mayapple commonly found on rich, moist woodlands are well known to wildflower enthusiasts.  These unusual plants spread by means of creeping rhizomes.  Each upright stem may grow to a foot or more tall and usually bears two large, peltate, orbicular, three- to nine- parted leaves.  A single flower arises from between the petioles of the two leaves.  Its fugacious perianth consists of six sepals and six to nine large, showy petals that surround the numerous yellow stamens.  The fragrant flower gives way to an ovoid, many-seeded berry that is reported to be edible, though its seeds and its vegetative parts contain poisonous substances.  Mayapple appears early in the spring and flowers and fruits in a short period.  It is easy to cultivate if provided with a moist, shady environment.  Podophyllum, a genus of nearly a dozen species, is mostly Asian; only this one grows in the United States.  Although generally placed in the barberry family, some specialists segregate it into the Podophyllaceae."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 34</abstract>
