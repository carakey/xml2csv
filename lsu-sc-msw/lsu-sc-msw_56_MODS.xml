   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"One of the early signs of spring is the small, bright red flowers and the conspicuous, crimson, winged fruits of Drummond's red maple, which stand out against the gray, leafless trees of the Louisiana bottomland forests.  The leaves of the red maple drawn for the Louisiana Flora Project are larger than those of the typical variety and are more densely covered with small, matted, white hairs on their lower surfaces.  Both varieties of red maple are grown for ornamental and shade purposes.  To grow this maple for the colorful fruits, a female tree must be selected because the pollen-producing and the fruit-producing flowers commonly appear on separate plants."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.12</abstract>
