   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Originally native to the Appalachian and Ozark Mountains, black locust is now naturalized throughout much of the United States and Europe.  This often-cultivated ornamental produces copious amounts of seed, and unless controlled, it will generally form thickets by means of root sprouts once it is established.  Wood from the trunks is said to be highly resistant to decay and is useful for posts and pilings.  Black locust is a medium-size tree normally growing to about sixty feet tall.  Leaves of this species are alternate and pinnately compound with as many as twenty-five leaflets.  At the base of the leaf stalk and modified from the stipules is a pair of sharp spines that may be up to one inch in length.  Appearing in the spring, its lovely, delicately fragrant flowers hang in pendulous racemes.  The petals of the pealike flowers are a creamy white, and the standard bears a yellow patch.  When fully formed, black locust bears beanlike pods about four inches long."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 92</abstract>
