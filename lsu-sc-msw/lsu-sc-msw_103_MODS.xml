   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Lundell's locoweed is a low perennial with many branches bearing featherlike leaves and terminal, compact racemes of pale lemon-yellow flowers and, later, beanlike fruit. This rare species of locoweed is restricted to deep, sandy soils in western Louisiana and eastern Texas. Because of its rareness, it had never been given a common name until the author provided it with one. Various members of the genus are called locoweed because they absorb selenium from the soil and consequently cause nervous disorders in livestock that graze on them. Astragalus, a large genus of about fifteen hundred species, grows mostly in arid regions. Because only six species of Astragalus are known in Louisiana, they are local curiosities."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.57</abstract>
