   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Flowers of the familiar, high-climbing Carolina jessamine suffuse the thickets of woodland borders and fencerows in the early spring with brilliant yellow.  The species is common throughout most of Louisiana and the southeastern United States.  Its high-climbing habit, earlier flowering period, and delicately scented flowers distinguish Carolina jessamine from the similar swamp jessamine.  Carolina jessamine is a popular garden ornamental often grown on trellises, fences, and mailbox posts.  In direct sun, the plant forms a more compact habit and flowers more abundantly.  The species is readily propagated from seeds, cuttings, and divisions.  Its epithet sempervirens means "evergreen."  Alkaloids contained in the roots, leaves, and nectar are toxic and may cause poisoning if consumed.  Carolina jessamine reportedly was introduced into England in 1640 and illustrated in that year by John Parkinson in his Theatrum Botanicum ( http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;res_id=xri:eebo&amp;rft_id=xri:eebo:image:22703) ."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 141
