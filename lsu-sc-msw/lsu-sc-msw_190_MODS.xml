   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Although widespread from Maine to Ohio southward and fairly frequent in wet woodlands and bogs and along the borders of swamps and bays, this species is less well known than the wild azalea.  Summer azalea also can grow to about twenty feet tall, and it has alternate, deciduous leaves.  Its flower buds, which are formed the previous season and over winter, are covered with a sticky, viscous substance--presumably, the reason for the epithet viscosum.  This species flowers in very late spring or in summer after the leaves have matured.  In flower, this plant is not as spectacular as the wild azalea; it has fewer flowers, which are somewhat concealed by the leaves, and its less-colorful corollas are creamy white.  There is considerable controversy concerning the specific boundaries, and consequently the correct name, for this species.  Summer azalea may be an interesting garden plant in moist to wet habitats.  It could also provide genetic material for developing later-flowering varieties of azaleas by hybridization with other species."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 56</abstract>
