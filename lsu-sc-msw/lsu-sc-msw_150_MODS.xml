   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Winter buds on naked twigs burst into magenta blooms with the first warming of spring.  Subsequent to flowering, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of reddish brown pods adorn the branches of redbud.  The flowers, which exhibit showy banner, wing, and keel petals, and the beanlike pods are unmistakably leguminous.  Redbud is a popular ornamental, and numerous horticultural selections are available.  The flower buds may be eaten and make an unusual and colorful garnish for salads.  Cercis canadensis, which grows as an understory tree in hardwood forests of the eastern United States, is one of a handful of redbud species known from North America, Europe, and Asia."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.59</abstract>
