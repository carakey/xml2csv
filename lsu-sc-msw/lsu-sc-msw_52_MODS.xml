   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Perhaps more familiar to most Louisianans than our native devilwood is its exotic and often cultivated relative, the sweet olive.  Devilwood appears to be restricted in Louisiana to the Florida Parishes, and it is rather common in certain localities.  This generally small tree reportedly can grow to nearly forty feet tall with a trunk diameter approaching two feet.  Like sweet olive, its leathery leaves are opposite and simple.  The flowers of devilwood are contained in small, scaly bracted, branched clusters, and though not as fragrant, they are similar to those of sweet olive in size and construction.  Devilwood flowers are polygamous, meaning that bisexual and unisexual flowers are produced on the same plant.  Fruits of devilwood are purplish drupes similar in appearance to small olives.  Although rarely seen in cultivation, devilwood has potential as a useful landscape plant."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 147</abstract>
