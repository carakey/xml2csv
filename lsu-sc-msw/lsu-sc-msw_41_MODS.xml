   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"The catchfly gentian may be found near the Gulf of Mexico in Cameron Parish and sporadically in some of the other coastal parishes and states.  Preference for wet alkaline of saline soils may be a factor restricting its distribution.  This annual species commonly grows to two feet tall, and its evenly spaced, obovate pairs of leaves clasp the stems.  Both the stems and the leaves are covered with a waxy substance that gives the plants a bluish color.  In summer, large, showy, bell-shaped flowers open from spindle-shaped buds produced singly form the tips of long pedicels.  Their petal lobes vary from bluish to lavender, while the petal bases are a deeper shade of purple.  The stamens typically number five and are a vivid yellow.  Numerous lustrous, chestnut brown seeds develop from inch-long capsules."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 95</abstract>
