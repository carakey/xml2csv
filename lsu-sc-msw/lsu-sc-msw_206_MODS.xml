   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Easily recognized by its apically truncate, four-lobed leaves, tulip tree is widespread on mesic sites in the eastern United States.  In certain habitats, it may be a predominant forest species and a giant as well.  The national champion tree, growing in Virginia, is reported to have a height of 124 feet and a trunk circumference of 30 feet 3 inches.  Its scientific name, which literally means "tulip bearing tulip tree," seems redundant but emphatically calls attention to the tree's attractive flowers.  Six yellowish green perianth parts, the same number as in the tulip flower, are each highlighted with a vivid orange basal spot.  Three greenish, reflexed stamens unfurl below the petals, and within occur numerous stamens and pistils.  The rather conelike aggregates of winged fruits persist on the tree after its leaves have been shed.  Tulip tree is an attractive ornamental because of its pyramidal form, its ash gray bark of interlacing ridges, and its unusual flowers and foliage.  It is also a useful timber species."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 124</abstract>
