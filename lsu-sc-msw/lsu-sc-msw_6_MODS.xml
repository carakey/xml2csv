   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Except for having green leaves rather than variously colored ones, arrow arum somewhat resembles its relative, the commonly cultivated caladium. Both plants have arrowhead-shaped blades supported on long petioles.  Under favorable conditions, arrow arum may grow to three feet in height from a tuberouslike rhizome.  Its unisexual flowers are borne on a specialized inflorescence called a spadix.  Both types of flowers are small and lack sepals and petals.  The female flowers are located near the base of the inflorescence axis and essentially consist only of a pistil.  Represented by tiny, shield-shaped scales each supporting four to eight anthers, the pollen-bearing flowers occupy the apical part of the axis.  The generic name is descriptive of this plant's peculiar, shield-shaped anther supports.  Surrounding the spadix is a leaflike bract called a spathe, which may range from green to yellowish in color.  At maturity, the berrylike fruits may remain green or turn brown.  Arrow arum is also related to jack-in-the-pulpit, green dragon, and golden club."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 5</abstract>
