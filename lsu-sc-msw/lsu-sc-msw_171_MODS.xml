   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Graceful, arching, leafy stems typify Solomon's seal, a plant of the rich, wooded slopes of eastern North America.  From the axils of each leaf are two or sometimes more pendulous flower; each blossom's six-parted perianth is fused into a tubular corolla with tiny lobes.  Within the corolla are six stamens, the number typical for members of the lily family.  Berries, the fruits of this plant, are fist green, turning dark purple when mature.  Shoots and roots of Solomon's seal are said to be edible.  Although reported from several parishes, this species is uncommon in Louisiana.  Solomon's seal is a relatively easy plant to grow in the shade garden if provided with rich, moist, but well-drained soil.  Different accounts have been given for this plant's common name.  The leaf scars on the rhizome resemble a seal's impression into the wax used on letters or documents in former times.  Alternatively, the ancients thought that medicines prepared from the roots of this plant had magical healing properties like those of the healing acts that could have been performed by Solomon."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 116</abstract>
