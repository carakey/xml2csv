   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"As suggested by the scientific and common names, this plant resembles species in the related genus Liatris, the blazing stars.  Both kinds of plants have lavender flowers clustered together in heads, a typical formation for members of the sunflower family.  The heads of false liatris form rather compact, flat-topped clusters, whereas the heads of blazing star generally form cylindrical clusters.  The basal leaves of false liatris are long and narrow.  The numerous stem leaves are also narrow and become progressively shorter toward the top of the stem.  False liatris grows in wet pine savannas of the Gulf Coastal Plain and flowers in late summer and autumn."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.9</abstract>
