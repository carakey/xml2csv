   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Frog's bit commonly forms dense, floating mats in shallow, quiet ponds or roots in the wet mud of marshy habitats.  Each plant consists of a rosette of nearly heart-shaped leaf blades supported by relatively long petioles.  Spongy, air-filled tissue composes the leaves, increases the plat's buoyancy, and facilitates gas exchange with the atmosphere.  As a means of vegetative propagation, the plant develops runners upon which plantlets are formed.  Seeds are also produced in the female flowers of this monoecious species.  Both the staminate and the pistillate flowers possess three sepals and three petals.  The flowers appear one at a time in the leaf axils.  Six to twelve stamens with fused filaments characterize the male flower while the female is recognizable by its typically six, deeply divided stigmas and its inferior ovary, which forms a berrylike fruit."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 96</abstract>
