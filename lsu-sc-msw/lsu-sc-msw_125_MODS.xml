   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"The epithet commemorates Mark Catesby, who wrote and illustrated The Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands, published between 1731 and 1743.  He illustrated the pine lily in Volume Two, plate fifty-eight, in 1736.  Pine lily grows in wet pine savannas of the coastal plain from Louisiana to Virginia.  Although this species had been documented for this state by collections in the 1930s, it had not been observed in the wild for some time.  Only through diligent searches by several individuals were extant populations rediscovered.  Pine lily grows to a height of about two feet.  Unlike the Carolina lily, pine lily has alternate leaves, and each of its stems forms a bright rusty red to orange with yellowish bases.  The six large, rust-colored anthers are supported in the central part of the flower by long filaments.  As is characteristic of most lilies, this plant has a small, scaly bulb below the ground.  If grown in suitable habitat, this species would be an attractive and unusual garden plant.  Successful propagation may be obtained from seeds and daughter bulbs."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 112</abstract>
