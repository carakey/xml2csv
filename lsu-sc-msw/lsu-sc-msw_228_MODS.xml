   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Aureolaria dispersa may be found from late summer through autumn in open, sandy pine-oak woods in the lower one-half of Louisiana and also in Texas eastward to Alabama. The plant's lower leaves are often deeply pinnately lobed, and its large, glossy, yellow flowers cling solitarily or in pairs, forming racemes at the numerous branch tips of this perennial. The corollas may be as long as two inches and are suitable for visitation by certain bees. Four anthers, located near the entrance in the upper part of the corolla, are positioned to apply pollen to the backs of such visitors. Like many species in the figwort family Aureolaria is a root parasite on other kinds of plants."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.201</abstract>
