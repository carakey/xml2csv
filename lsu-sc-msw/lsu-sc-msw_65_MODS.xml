   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Baldderworts are aquatic, usually rootless, carnivorous plants often having whorls of feathery branches.  Sophisticated traps attached on short stalks along the branches are adapted to catch very small animals.  The traps are tiny, sacklike structures in which develops negative pressure, caused by the activities of associated glands.  A small insect or crustacean swimming near the entrance to the trap will brush against the several bristles, stimulating a flap of tissue-the door-that guards the entrance to open suddenly.  Water flows into the trap, sweeping the animal with it.  The door closes, entrapping the tiny creature, which is subsequently digested.  Floating bladderwort grows in shallow ponds and ditches in the coastal plain of the Southeast.  From its base radiate several branches with swollen stalks and midribs that function as flotation devices supporting the flower stalks.  Located along the branches are the numerous traps.  Its inflorescence consists of from five to fifteen flowers.  The corollas are golden yellow, spurred, and two-lipped, and the lower lip is often streaked or dotted with red."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.110</abstract>
