   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Characterized by delicate, pale yellow flowers, the puccoon is a widely distributed woodland wildflower.  Like most members of the borage family, its stems and leaves are covered with coarse, stiff, white hairs, and its inflorescences when young are coiled like a scorpion's tail.  As the flowers mature, the inflorescence axis straightens.  The five-lobed calyx surrounds the base of the narrow corolla tube which abruptly flares into a five-lobed, disklike structure.  Concealed within the corolla tube are five tiny anthers.  Seeds are produced within each flower in four stony nutlets, as alluded to by the generic name, which literally means "stone seed."  A rather extensive rhizome system develops below ground, and upon drying, it diffuses a violet-colored substance, staining the paper upon which specimens of this species are mounted.  Most members of the borage family are relatively inconspicuous plants of various habitats, but a few are well-known ornamentals such as comfrey and Myosotis, the forget-me-nots."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 47</abstract>
