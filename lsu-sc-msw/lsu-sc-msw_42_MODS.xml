   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"The sky blue flowers of the celestial lily usually occur in pairs, as suggested by its specific epithet geminiflora, which means "twin flower." The generic name Nemastylis is Greek and refers to the six slender, threadlike style branches arising from the central part of the flower.  Although spectacular, the flowers are ephemeral and can be seen only from midmorning until they fade a few hours later.  Its flower stalks, which grow to two feet in height, arise from an underground bulb and support two to three narrow, pleated leaves.  This plant is a member of the iris family and is not a lily, as suggested by its common name.  Celestial lily, found in open woods and prairies from central Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama northward to Kansas and Missouri, appears to be uncommon in the wild.  This plant has received little attention as an ornamental plant, but it probably would be suitable for the native plant garden.  The genus Nemastylis contains three other species found in the southern United States and another in Mexico."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 88</abstract>
