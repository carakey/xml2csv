   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Although Indian paint brush carpets vast areas of southeastern Texas with its bright red floral displays, it is rather uncommon in Louisiana.  The few reports of this plant come from scattered areas in the western part of Louisiana and may represent accidental introductions from Texas.  Indian paint brush is an annual that may grow in dense colonies.  Individual plants are about one foot in height and have numerous narrow leaves.  The most colorful part of the flowering spikes are structures called bracts that are yellow with brilliant red tips, giving the appearance of having been dipped in paint.  The flower petals are pale yellow and contribute little color to the plant.  Castilleja, named in honor of the Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo, is primarily a genus of the western United States, where some 250 species exhibit a perplexing degree of variability."  -- Lowell Urbatsch, in The Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1991), p.202</abstract>
