   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Blue water lily inhabits canals, marshes, ponds, and swamps near the Gulf Coast from northeastern Mexico to Florida.  This species is frequently seen in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, but appears to be rare or absent elsewhere in the state.  A short, tuber-bearing rhizome anchors the plant to the mud in relatively shallow water.  Its floating, orbicular to broadly oval-shaped leaf blades are dark green above and may be red to purple beneath, and they resemble those of the more common white water lily.  The faintly fragrant flowers of blue water lily are generally supported above the water and have several pale blue petals that intensify in color when dried.  In typical water lily fashion, the central part of the flower contains many yellow stamens.  Numerous small seeds are formed in the somewhat-globose capsules.  Like other species of Nymphaea, this one would provide an attractive addition to the garden pond."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 147</abstract>
