   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Cow oak is common deciduous forest tree of the rich, mesic slopes and river bottom forests subject to floods of short duration.  The bark of its straight, upright trunk is light gray and shaggy, somewhat like that of white oak.  Leaves of cow oak, which clearly place it in the chestnut oak group, are usually six to eight inches long and have about a dozen large teeth along each edge and several evenly spaced, secondary veins running from the midvein to the margin.  Flowers of both sexes occur on the same tree.  The staminate flowers form dense, drooping catkins, and the seed-producing ones are borne singly or in small clusters.  Relatively large acorns with caps about one-half their length mature in one season.  Cow oak is a desirable shade tree and timber species.  Because the wood splits evenly into thin strips, it is used for basket-making and for shingles.  Late in the season, the leaves of cow oak become red, and it is one of the few species in the Deep South to dependably provide autumn coloration.  The scientific name for this species has been the source of confusion over the years.  Quercus prinus, a name often used for cow oak, is no longer in use."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 76</abstract>
