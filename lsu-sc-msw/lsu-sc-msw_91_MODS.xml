   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Among our many species of Eupatorium, the Joe-Pye-weed, which easily reaches ten feet in height, is the tallest.  Other distinctive features include its long, lanceolate, whorled leaves and great, dome-shaped clusters of flowers.  Each of its numerous heads contains five to eight lilac-pink flowers.  The epithet fistulosum refers to the plant's hollow stems.  Its curious common name is derived from Joe Pye, who is said to have been a native American who used the plants in medicinal practices.  This common name is generally applied to three other, similar species variously distributed in the eastern United States.  Although not widely used as a garden plant, Joe-Pye-weed makes an attractive background for other, smaller native wildflowers and may be propagated from seeds or by root cuttings."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 11</abstract>
