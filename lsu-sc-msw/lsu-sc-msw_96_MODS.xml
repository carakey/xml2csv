   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Dense colonies of lizard's tail become conspicuous in the late springtime in swamps and wet ditches as the flowers on the long, tapering, drooping inflorescences come into bloom.  Surprisingly, the showy, white, usually fragrant flowers lack sepals and petals and owe their color largely to the filaments of their numerous stamens.  The simple, heart-shaped leaves are alternately arranged, and at each node a narrow scar encircles the stem.  Only one other species is contained in the genus Saururus, S. chinensis of the Philippines and eastern Asia.  In fact, the Saururaceae embraces a total of seven species.  Anemopsis californica is native to southwestern North America, and Houttuynia cordata, an Asian plant sometimes used as an ornamental ground cover and for salads, has been recorded as a recent introduction to Louisiana."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.199</abstract>
