   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Sassafras occupies a prominent position among our native culinary plants.  Fil√©, a fine powder of ground sassafras leaves, imparts a distinctive flavor to gumbo, a popular South Louisiana dish.  Sassafras tea, made by steeping pieces of the root or bark, has been a popular drink since the early colonization of this country.  Sassafras oil, distilled from the bark of the roots, is used to flavor medicines and candy and in scenting some perfumes.  Unfortunately, safrole, one major component of sassafras oil, has been shown to be mildly carcinogenic in laboratory animals.  Sassfras is a deciduous, dioecious tree common in old fields and woodlands of Louisiana and the eastern United States.  Leaves, especially of young trees, are mitten-shaped, and both right- and left-handed "mittens" as well as ones with two thumbs, are produced.  Leaves of older trees--which incidentally can become one hundred feet tall with trunk diameters of three to four feet--tend to be unlobed.  Both the male and the female flowers are small, yellowish green, and radially symmetrical with six perianth segments.  Male flowers have nine stamens and release their pollen by means of tiny, flaplike doors, a feature characteristic of the laurel family.  Sassafras fruits are purple drupes supported by a fleshy, enlarged, reddish petiole."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.108</abstract>
