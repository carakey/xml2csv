   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Widespread throughout much of the eastern United States and often locally abundant, rose pogonia is, in general, an uncommon plant.  It frequents wet meadows and bogs.  In Louisiana, it has been reported in several southeastern and central parishes.  The plants typically grow from delicate fibrous root systems.  In our area, the stems are about four to five inches tall, and each bears one leaf at its midpoint and a leaflike bract below the inflorescence.  Because of its single leaf, rose pogonia resembles the adder's tongue fern, and its specific epithet calls attention to this similarity.  One or sometimes a few fragrant flowers individually subtended by a leafy bract are produced per plant.  The petal-like sepals are spreading and resemble the two pale pink to rose petals that appear to hover above the column.  The third petal is modified into the lip, which is pink with a deep rose fringe around its margins.  Along its length, except at the base, are three rows of densely packed, yellow bristles."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p. 154</abstract>
