   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Spring beauty is a tufted, perennial herb that grows from an underground corm.  Its linear leaves, like those of most members of the purslane family, are somewhat succulent.  The raceme on each stem produces about a dozen delicate flowers, which are individually composed of two sepals and five petals.  Typically pink, the petals may vary from white to rose with purple veins.  The purplish stamens number the same as the petals and are attached to them.  Spring beauty grows in lawns, fields, and rich sandy woodlands throughout the eastern states and may be grown in the native plant garden for its decorative flowers."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.192</abstract>
